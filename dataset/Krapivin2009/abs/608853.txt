We present a new pattern generation approach for deterministic built-in self testing (BIST) of sequential circuits. Our approach is based on precomputed test sequences, and is especially suited to sequential circuits that contain a large number of flip-flops but relatively few controllable primary inputs. Such circuits, often encountered as embedded cores and as filters for digital signal processing, are difficult to test and require long test sequences. We show that statistical encoding of precomputed test sequences can be combined with low-cost pattern decoding to provide deterministic BIST with practical levels of overhead. Optimal Huffman codes and near-optimal Comma codes are especially useful for test set encoding. This approach exploits recent advances in automatic test pattern generation for sequential circuits and, unlike other BIST schemes, does not require access to a gate-level model of the circuit under test. It can be easily automated and integrated with design automation tools. Experimental results for the ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits show that the proposed method provides higher fault coverage than pseudorandom testing with shorter test application time and low to moderate hardware overhead.
