The authors consider uniform subclasses of the nonuniform  complexity classes defined by Karp and Lipton [L'Enseign. Math., 28 (1982)] via the notion of advice functions. These  subclasses are obtained by restricting the complexity of  computing correct advice.  Also, the effect of allowing  advice functions of limited complexity to depend on the  input rather than on the input's length is investigated.  Among other results, using the notions described above,  new characterizations of (a) $NP^{NP\cap SPARSE}$, (b) $\NP$ with  a restricted access to an $\NP$ oracle, and (c) the odd  levels of the boolean hierarchy are given.  As a consequence, it is shown that every set that is nondeterministically truth-table reducible to SAT in the  sense of Rich [J. Comput. System Sci., 38 (1989),  pp. 511--523] is already deterministically truth-table reducible  to SAT. Furthermore, it turns out that the $\NP$  reduction classes of bounded versions of this reducibility  coincide with the odd levels of the boolean hierarchy.
