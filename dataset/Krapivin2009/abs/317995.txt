For admission control in real-time multimedia systems, buffer space, disk bandwidth and network bandwidth must be considered. The CBR-based mechanisms do not use system resources effectively, since media data is usually encoded with VBR compression techniques. We propose an admission control mechanism based on a VBR data model that has a dynamic period length. In our mechanism, the period can be adaptively changed to maximize the performance, considering both disk bandwidth and buffer space. To compare the performance, extensive simulations are conducted on RR, SCAN, and GSS schemes which have the dynamic period length and the static period length.
