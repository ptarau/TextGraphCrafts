AbstractThe World Wide Web is rich in content and services, but access to these resources must be obtained mostly through manual browsers. We would like to be able to write programs that reproduce human browsing behavior, including reactions to slow transmission-rates and failures on many simultaneous links. We thus introduce a concurrent model that directly incorporates the notions of failure and rate of communication, and then describe programming constructs based on this model.
