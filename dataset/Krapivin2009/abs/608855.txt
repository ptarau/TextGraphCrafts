The purpose of this paper is to develop a global design for test methodology for testing a core-based system in its entirety. This is achieved by introducing a bypass mode for each core by which the data can be transferred from a core input port to the output port without interfering the core circuitry itself. The interconnections are thoroughly tested because they are used to propagate test data (patterns or signatures) in the system. The system is modeled as a directed weighted graph in which the accessibility (of the core input and output ports) is solved as a shortest path problem. Finally, a pipelined test schedule is made to overlap accessing input ports (to send test patterns) and output ports (to observe the signatures). The experimental results show higher fault coverage and shorter test time.
