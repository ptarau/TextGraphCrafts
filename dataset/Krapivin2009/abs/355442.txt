We consider the volumetric barrier for semidefinite programming, or "generalized" volumetric barrier, as introduced by Nesterov and Nemirovskii. We extend several fundamental properties of the volumetric barrier for a polyhedral set to the semidefinite case. Our analysis facilitates a simplified proof of self-concordance for the semidefinite volumetric barrier, as well as for the combined volumetric-logarithmic barrier for semidefinite programming. For both of these barriers we obtain self-concordance parameters equal to those previously shown to hold in the polyhedral case.
