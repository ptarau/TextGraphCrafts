This paper studies a notion called polynomial-time membership comparable sets. For a function $g$, a set $A$ is polynomial-time $g$-membership comparable if there is a polynomial-time computable function $f$ such that for any $x_1, \cdots, x_m$ with $m \geq g(\max\{ |x_1|, \cdots, |x_m| \})$, outputs $b \in \{0,1\}^m$ such that $(A(x_1), \cdots, A(x_m)) \neq b$. The following is a list of major results proven in the paper.  1. Polynomial-time membership comparable sets construct  a proper hierarchy according to the bound on the number  of arguments.  2. Polynomial-time membership comparable sets have  polynomial-size circuits.  3. For any function $f$ and for any constant $c>0$,  if a set is $\leq^p_{f(n)-tt}$-reducible to a P-selective set,  then the set is polynomial-time $(1+c)\log f(n)$-membership  comparable.  4. For any $\cal C$ chosen from $\{ {\rm PSPACE, UP, FewP, NP, C_{=}P, PP, MOD_{2}P, MOD_{3}}, \cdots \}$,  if $\cal C \subseteq {\rm P-mc}(c\log n)$ for some $c<1$,  then $\cal As a corollary of the last two results, it is shown that if there is some constant $c<1$ such that all of $\cal C$ are polynomial-time $n^c$-truth-table reducible to some P-selective sets, then $\cal which resolves a question that has been left open for a long time.
