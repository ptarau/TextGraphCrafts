Qualitative probabilistic networks are qualitative abstractions of probabilistic networks, summarising probabilistic influences by qualitative signs. As qualitative networks model influences at the level of variables, knowledge about probabilistic influences that hold only for specific values cannot be expressed. The results computed from a qualitative network, as a consequence, can be weaker than strictly necessary and may in fact be rather uninformative. We extend the basic formalism of qualitative probabilistic networks by providing for the inclusion of context-specific information about influences and show that exploiting this information upon reasoning has the ability to forestall unnecessarily weak results.
