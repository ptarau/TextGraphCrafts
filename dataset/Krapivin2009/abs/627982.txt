AbstractIn this paper, we define the generalization problem, summarize various approaches in generalization, identify the credit assignment problem, and present the problem and some solutions in measuring generalizability. We discuss anomalies in the ordering of hypotheses in a subdomain when performance is normalized and averaged, and show conditions under which anomalies can be eliminated. To generalize performance across subdomains, we present a measure called probability of win that measures the probability whether one hypothesis is better than another. Finally, we discuss some limitations in using probabilities of win and illustrate their application in finding new parameter values for TimberWolf, a package for VLSI cell placement and routing.
