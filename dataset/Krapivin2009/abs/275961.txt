We analyze the preconditioned Chebyshev iteration in which at each step the linear system involving the preconditioner is solved inexactly by an inner iteration. We allow the  tolerance used in the inner iteration to decrease from one outer iteration to the next. When the tolerance converges to zero, the asymptotic convergence rate is the same as for the exact method. Motivated by this result, we seek the sequence of tolerance  values that yields the lowest  cost to achieve a specified accuracy. We find that among all sequences of slowly varying  tolerances, a constant one is optimal. Numerical calculations that verify our results are presented. Asymptotic methods, such as the W.K. B. method for linear recurrence equations, are used with an estimate of the accuracy  of the asymptotic result.
