Abstract: Software synthesis is a new approach which focuses on the support of embedded systems without the use of operating systems. Compared to traditional design practices, a better utilization of the available time and hardware resources can be achieved, because the static information provided by the system specification is fully exploited and an application-specific solution is automatically generated. On-going research on a software synthesis approach for real-time information processing systems is presented which starts from a concurrent process system specification and tries to automate the mapping of this description to a single processor. An internal representation model which is well-suited for the support of concurrency and timing constraints is proposed, together with flexible execution models for multi-tasking with real-time constraints. The method is illustrated on a personal terminal receiver demodulator for mobile satellite communication.
