A vertex (edge) coloring $\phi:V\rightarrow \{1,2,\ldots ,t\}$ ($\phi':E\rightarrow \{1,2,\ldots,$ $t\}$) of a graph G=(V,E) is a vertex (edge) t-ranking if, for any two vertices (edges) of the same color, every path between them contains a vertex (edge) of larger color. The {\em vertex ranking number} $\chi_{r}(G)$ ({\em edge ranking number} $\chi_{r}'(G)$) is the smallest value of t such that G has a vertex (edge) t-ranking. In this paper we study the algorithmic complexity of the {\sc Vertex Ranking} and {\sc Edge Ranking} problems. It is shown that $\chi_{r}(G)$ can be computed in polynomial time when restricted to graphs with treewidth at most k for any fixed k. We characterize the graphs where the vertex ranking number $\chi_{r}$ and the chromatic number $\chi$ coincide on all induced subgraphs, show that $\chi_{r}(G)=\chi (G)$ implies $\chi (G)=\omega (G)$ (largest clique size), and give a formula for $\chi_{r}'(K_n)$.
