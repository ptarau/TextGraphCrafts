We consider the view data lineageproblem in a warehousing environment: For a given data item in a materialized warehouse view, we want to identify the set of source data items that produced the view item. We formally define the lineage problem, develop lineage tracing algorithms for relational views with aggregation, and propose mechanisms for performing consistent lineage tracing in a multisource data warehousing environment. Our result can form the basis of a tool that allows analysts to browse warehouse data, select view tuples of interest, and then drill-through to examine the exact source tuples that produced the view tuples of interest.
