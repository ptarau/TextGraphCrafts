We present a simple randomized algorithm which solves linear programs with n constraints and d variables in expected O(nde(d ln(n+1))1/4) time in the unit cost model (where we count the number of arithmetic operations on the numbers in the input). The expectation is over the internal randomizations performed by the algorithm, and holds for any input. The algorithm is presented in an abstract framework, which facilitates its application to several other related problems. The algorithm has been presented in a previous work by the authors [ShW], but its analysis and the subexponential complexity bound are new.
