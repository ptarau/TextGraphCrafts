The introduction of powerful workstations connected through local area networks (LANs) inspired new database management system (DBMS) architectures that offer high performance characteristics. The authors examine three such software architecture configurations: client-server (CS), the RAD-UNIFY type of DBMS (RU), and enhanced client-server (ECS). Their specific functional components and design rationales are discussed. Three simulation models are used to provide a performance comparison under different job workloads. Simulation results show that the RU almost always performs slightly better than the CS, especially under light workloads, and that ECS offers significant performance improvement over both CS and RU. Under reasonable update rates, the ECS over CS (or RU) performance ratio is almost proportional to the number of participating clients (for less than clients). The authors also examine the impact of certain key parameters on the performance of the three architectures and show that ECS is more scalable that the other two.
