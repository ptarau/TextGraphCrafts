A novel algorithm, called the lambda test, is presented for an efficient and accurate data dependence analysis of multidimensional array references. It extends the numerical methods to allow all dimensions of array references to be tested simultaneously. Hence, it combines the efficiency and the accuracy of both approaches. This algorithm has been implemented in Parafrase, a Fortran program parallelization restructurer developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Some experimental results are presented to show its effectiveness.
