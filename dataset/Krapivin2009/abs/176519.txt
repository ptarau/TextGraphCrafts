We show how precise groundness information can be extracted from logic programs. The idea is to use abstract interpretation with Boolean functions as approximations to groundness dependencies between variables. This idea is not new, and different classes of Boolean functions have been used. We argue, however, that one class, the positive functions, is more suitable than others. Positive Boolean functions have a certain property which we (inspired by A. Langen) call condensation. This property allows for rapid computation of groundness information.
