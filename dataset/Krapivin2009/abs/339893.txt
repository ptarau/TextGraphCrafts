An on-the-fly algorithm for model checking under fairness is presented. The algorithm utilizes symmetry in the program to reduce the state space, and employs novel techniques that make the on-the-fly model checking feasible. The algorithm uses state symmetry and eliminates parallel edges in the reachability graph. Experimental results demonstrating dramatic reductions in both the running time and memory usage are presented.
