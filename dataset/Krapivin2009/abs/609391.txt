This paper investigates interference cancellation (IC) in direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems that support multiple data rates. Two methods for implementing multiple data rates are considered. One is the use of mixed modulation and the other is the use of multicodes. We introduce and analyze a new approach that combines these multiple data rate systems with IC. The cancellation in the receiver is performed successively on each user, starting with the user received with the highest power. This procedure can in turn be iterated, forming a multistage scheme, with the number of iterations set as a design parameter. Our analysis employs a Gaussian approximation for the distribution of the interference, and it includes both the AWGN and the flat Rayleigh fading channel. The systems are also evaluated via computer simulations. Our analysis and simulations indicate that the IC schemes used in mixed modulation or multicode systems yield a performance close to the single BPSK user bound and, consequently, give a prospect of a considerable improvement in performance compared to systems employing matched filter detectors.
