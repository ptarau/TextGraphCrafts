Maintaining good mesh quality during the generation and refinement of unstructured meshes in finite-element applications is an important aspect in obtaining accurate discretizations and well-conditioned linear systems. In this article, we present a mesh-smoothing algorithm based on nonsmooth optimization techniques and a scalable implementation of this algorithm. We prove that the parallel algorithm has a provably fast runtime bound and executes correctly for a parallel random access machine (PRAM) computational model. We extend the PRAM algorithm to distributed memory computers and report results for two- and three-dimensional simplicial meshes that demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of this approach for a number of different test cases. We also examine the effect of different architectures on the parallel algorithm and present results for the IBM SP supercomputer and an ATM-connected network of SPARC Ultras.
