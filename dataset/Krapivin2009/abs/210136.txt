The spectral method is the best currently known technique to prove lower bounds on expansion. Ramanujan graphs, which have asymptotically optimal second eigenvalue, are the best-known explicit expanders. The spectral method yielded a lower bound of k/4 on the expansion of linear-sized subsets of k-regular Ramanujan graphs. We improve the lower bound on the expansion of Ramanujan graphs to approximately k/2. Moreover, we construct a family of k-regular graphs with asymptotically optimal second eigenvalue and linear expansion equal to k/2. This shows that k/2 is the best bound one can obtain using the second eigenvalue method. We also show an upper bound of roughly     1+k-1  on the average degree of linear-sized induced subgraphs of Ramanujan graphs. This compares positively with the classical bound   2k-1 . As a byproduct, we obtain improved results on random walks on expanders and construct selection networks (respectively, extrovert graphs) of smaller size (respectively, degree) than was previously known.
