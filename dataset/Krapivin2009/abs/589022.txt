We prove     sufficient   conditions for  the monotonicity and the strong monotonicity of    fixed point and normal maps associated with   variational inequality problems over a general closed convex set. Sufficient conditions for  the strong  monotonicity of their perturbed versions are also shown. These results include    some well known  in the literature as particular instances. Inspired by these results,   we propose   a modified Solodov and Svaiter iterative algorithm   for the  variational inequality problem whose   fixed point map  or normal map is monotone.
