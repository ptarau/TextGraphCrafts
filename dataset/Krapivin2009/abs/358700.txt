AbstractA sparse-mesh, which has PUs on the diagonal of a two-dimensional grid only, is a cost effective distributed memory machine. Variants of this machine have been considered before, but none are as simple and pure as a sparse-mesh. Various fundamental problems (routing, sorting, list ranking) are analyzed, proving that sparse-meshes have great potential. It is shown that on a two-dimensional $n \times n$ sparse-mesh, which has $n$ PUs, for h-relations can be routed in $(h steps. The results are extended for higher dimensional sparse-meshes. On a $d$-dimensional $n \times \cdots \times n$ sparse-mesh, with h-relations are routed in $(6 \cdot (d - 1) / \epsilon - steps.
