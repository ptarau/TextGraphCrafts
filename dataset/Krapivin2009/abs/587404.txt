We describe a parallel algorithm for computing incomplete factor (ILU) preconditioners. The algorithm attains a high degree of parallelism through graph partitioning and a two-level ordering strategy. Both the subdomains and the nodes within each subdomain are ordered to preserve concurrency. We show through an algorithmic analysis and through computational results that this algorithm is scalable. Experimental results include timings on three  parallel platforms for problems with up to 20 million unknowns running on up to 216 processors.  The resulting preconditioned Krylov solvers have the desirable property that the number of iterations required for convergence is insensitive to the number of processors.
