AbstractThis paper describes a distributed algorithm that implements the abstraction of e-Transaction: a transaction that executes exactly-once despite failures. Our algorithm is based on an asynchronous replication scheme that generalizes well-known active-replication and primary-backup schemes. We devised the algorithm with a three-tier architecture in mind: the end-user interacts with front-end clients (e.g., browsers) that invoke middle-tier application servers (e.g., web servers) to access back-end databases. The algorithm preserves the three-tier nature of the architecture and introduces a very acceptable overhead with respect to unreliable solutions.
