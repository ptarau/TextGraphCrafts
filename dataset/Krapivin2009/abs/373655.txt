We describe several  cryptographic schemes in quadratic function fields of odd characteristic.  In both the real and the imaginary representation of such a field,  we present a Diffie-Hellman-like key exchange protocol as well  as a public-key cryptosystem and a signature scheme of ElGamal  type. Several of these schemes are improvements of systems previously  found in the literature, while others are new. All systems are  based on an appropriate discrete logarithm problem. In the imaginary  setting, this is the discrete logarithm problem in the ideal  class group of the field, or equivalently, in the Jacobian of  the curve defining the function field. In the real case, the  problem in question is the task of computing distances in the  set of reduced principal ideals, which is a monoid under a suitable  operation. Currently, the best general algorithms for solving  both discrete logarithm problems are exponential (subexponential  only in fields of high genus), resulting in a possibly higher  level of security than that of conventional discrete logarithm  based schemes.
