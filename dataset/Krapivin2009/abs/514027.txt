Sum of Pseudoproducts (SPP) is a three level logic synthesis technique developed in recent years. In this framework we exploit the "regularity" of Boolean functions to decrease minimization time. Our main results are: 1) the regularity of a Boolean function  of n variables is expressed by its autosymmetry degree k (with 0 &xle; k &xle n), where means no regularity (that is, we are not able to provide any advantage over standard synthesis); 2) for k &xge; 1 the function is autosymmetric, and a new function k is identified in polynomial time; k is "equivalent" to, but smaller than , and depends on n-k variables only; 3) given a minimal SPP form for k a minimal SPP form for  is built in linear time; experimental results show that 61% of the functions in the classical Espresso benchmark suite are autosymmetric, and the SPP minimization time for them is critically reduced; we can also solve cases otherwise practically intractable. We finally discuss the role and meaning of autosymmetry.
