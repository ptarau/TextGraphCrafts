In this paper we present a new probabilistic clock synchronization algorithm, its prototype implementation and experimental results. The algorithm follows the client-server programming paradigm and is designed to work in a departmental environment with few servers and a number of clients connected through an arbitrary network topology. At the core of the algorithm is a remote clock reading method that mitigates the negative effects of message delay uncertainty. The implementation proves the effectiveness of this approach and corroborates the theoretical speculations.
