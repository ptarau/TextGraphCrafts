Revision programming is a formalism to describe and enforce updates of belief sets and databases. That formalism was extended by Fitting who assigned annotations to revision atoms. Annotations provide a way to quantify the confidence (probability) that a revision atom holds. The main goal of our paper is to reexamine the work of Fitting, argue that his semantics does not always provide results consistent with intuition, and to propose an alternative treatment of annotated revision programs. Our approach differs from that proposed by Fitting in two key aspects: we change the notion of a model of a program and we change the notion of a justified revision. We show that under this new approach fundamental properties of justified revisions of standard revision programs extend to the annotated case.
