We consider the following optimization problem for UMTS networks: For a specified teletraffic demand and possible base station locations, choose positions for base stations such that  the construction costs are below a given limit, as much teletraffic as possible is supplied, the ongoing costs are minimal, and the intra-cell interference in the range of each base station is low.  We prove that for a particular specification of teletraffic (the so called demand node concept), this problem has a polynomial-time approximation scheme, but cannot have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme unless
