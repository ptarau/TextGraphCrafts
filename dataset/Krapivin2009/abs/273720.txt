This paper presents a general construction of multidimensional interpolatory subdivision schemes. In particular, we provide a concrete method for the construction of bivariate interpolatory subdivision schemes of increasing smoothness by finding an appropriate mask to convolve with the mask of a three-direction box spline Br,r,r of equal multiplicities. The resulting mask for the interpolatory subdivision exhibits all the symmetries of the three-direction box spline and with this increased symmetry comes increased smoothness. Several examples are computed (for in terms of the refinement mask are established and applied to the examples to estimate their smoothness.
