This paper investigates the computational complexity of approximating  several \NP-optimization problems using the number of queries to an  \NP\ oracle as a complexity measure.  The results show a tradeoff  between the closeness of the approximation and the number of queries  required.  For an approximation factor $k(n)$, $\log \log_{k(n)} n$  queries to an \NP\ oracle can be used to approximate the maximum  clique size of a graph within a factor of $k(n)$.   However, this approximation cannot be achieved using fewer than  $\log \log_{k(n)} n - c$ queries to any oracle unless  is a constant that does not depend on $k$.   These results hold for approximation factors $k(n) \geq 2$ that  belong to a class of functions which includes any integer constant  function, $\log n$, $\log^{a} n$, and $n^{1/a}$.  Similar results  are obtained for Graph Coloring, Set Cover, and other \NP-optimization problems.
