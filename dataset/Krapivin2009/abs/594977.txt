The main goal of the Frequency Assignment Problem in mobile radio networks consists of assigning a limited number of frequencies to each radio cell in a cellular network while minimizing electromagnetic interference due to the reuse of frequencies. This problem, known to be NP-hard, is of great importance in practice since better solutions will allow a telecommunications operator to manage larger cellular networks. This paper presents a new Tabu Search algorithm for this application. The algorithm is tested on realistic and large problem instances and compared with other methods based on simulated annealing, constraint programming and graph coloring algorithms. Empirical evidence shows that the Tabu algorithm is very competitive by giving the best solutions to the tested instances.
