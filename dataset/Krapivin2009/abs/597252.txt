In this paper, we discuss the effect of the uncertainty in the duration of some multimedia objects on the quality of the presentation of multimedia scenarios. This uncertainty can be due to external factors such as the access delay over internet or the user interaction. An uncertain duration is often followed by a period of desynchronization during which the presentation deviates from the desired scenario. To solve this problem, we present in this paper a solution that integrates two complementary approaches which reduce the desynchronization and limit its propagation in the rest of the presentation. These approaches are non-blocking and use the flexibility in the duration of multimedia objects in order to resynchronize the presentation as rapidly as possible.
