AbstractReal-time systems are being increasingly used in several applications which are time-critical in nature. Fault tolerance is an essential requirement of such systems, due to the catastrophic consequences of not tolerating faults. In this paper, we study a scheme that guarantees the timely recovery from multiple faults within hard real-time constraints in uniprocessor systems. Assuming earliest-deadline-first scheduling (EDF) for aperiodic preemptive tasks, we develop a necessary and sufficient feasibility-check algorithm for fault-tolerant scheduling with complexity $O(n^2 \cdot k)$, where $n$ is the number of tasks to be scheduled and $k$ is the maximum number of faults to be tolerated.
