We first study the capacity of Nakagami multipath fading (NMF) channels  with an average power constraint for three power and rate adaptation  policies. We obtain closed-form solutions for NMF  channel capacity for each power and rate adaptation strategy.  Results show that rate adaptation is the key to increasing  link spectral efficiency.  We then analyze  the performance of practical constant-power variable-rate M-QAM schemes  over NMF channels. We obtain closed-form  expressions for the outage probability, spectral efficiency and  average bit-error-rate (BER) assuming perfect channel  estimation and negligible time delay between channel estimation  and signal set adaptation. We also  analyze the impact of time delay on the BER of adaptive M-QAM.
