An augmented Lagrangian SQP method is discussed for a class of nonlinear optimal control problems in Banach spaces with constraints on the control. The convergence of the method is investigated by its equivalence with the generalized Newton method for the optimality system of the augmented optimal control problem. The method is shown to be quadratically convergent, if the optimality system of the standard non-augmented SQP method is strongly regular in the sense of Robinson. This result is applied to a test problem for the heat equation with Stefan-Boltzmann boundary condition. The numerical tests confirm the theoretical results.
