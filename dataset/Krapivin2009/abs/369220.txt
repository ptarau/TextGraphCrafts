The problem of fast searching of a pattern that contains Classes of characters and Bounded size Gaps (CBG) in a text has a wide range of applications, among which a very important one is protein pattern matching (for instance, one PROSITE protein site is associated with the CBG [RK]  x(2, where the brackets match any of the letters inside, and x(2, 3) a gap of length between 2 and 3). Currently, the only way to search a CBG in a text is to convert it into a full regular expression (RE). However, a RE is more sophisticated than a CBG, and searching it with a RE pattern matching algorithm complicates the search and makes it slow. This is the reason why we design in this article two new practical CBG matching algorithms that are much simpler and faster than all the RE search techniques. The first one looks exactly once at each text character. The second one does not need to consider all the text characters and hence it is usually faster than the first one, but in bad cases may have to read the same text character more than once. We then propose a criterion based on the form of the CBG to choose a-priori the fastest between both. We performed many practical experiments using the PROSITE database, and all them show that our algorithms are the fastest in virtually all cases.
