We present a class of subposets of the partition lattice n with the following property: The order complex is homotopy equivalent to the order complex of n  1, and the Sn-module structure of the homology coincides with a recently discovered lifting of the Sn 1-action on the homology of n  1. This is the Whitehouse representation on Robinsons space of fully-grown trees, and has also appeared in work of Getzler and Kapranov, Mathieu, Hanlon and Stanley, and Babson et al.One example is the subposet Pnn 1 of the lattice of set partitions n, obtained by removing all elements with a unique nontrivial block. More generally, for 2  k  n the subposet of the partition lattice obtained by removing all elements with a unique nontrivial block of size equal to k, and let Pnk &equals; \bigcapi &equals; 2k Qni. We show that Pnk is Cohen-Macaulay, and that Pnk and Qnk are both homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres of dimension (n  4), with Betti number (n  1) \!{n - k\over k}. The posets Qnk are neither shellable nor Cohen-Macaulay. We show that the Sn-module structure of the homology generalises the Whitehouse module in a simple way.We also present a short proof of the well-known result that rank-selection in a poset preserves the Cohen-Macaulay property.
