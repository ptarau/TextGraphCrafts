AbstractWe show how to automatically acquire Euclidian shape representations of objects from noisy image sequences under weak perspective. The proposed method is linear and incremental, requiring no more than pseudoinverse. A nonlinear, but numerically sound preprocessing stage is added to improve the accuracy of the results even further. Experiments show that attention to noise and computational techniques improves the shape results substantially with respect to previous methods proposed for ideal images.
