Program slicing is an important approach to testing, understanding and maintaining programs. The paper presents a slicing algorithm for concurrent Java programs. Because the execution process of concurrent programs is unpredictable, there are many problems to be solved when slicing. To slice concurrent Java programs, we present concurrent control flow graphs and concurrent program dependence graphs to representconcurrent Java programs. Based on these models, we design an efficient static slicing algorithm for concurrent Java programs. The algorithm may get more precise slices than previous approaches we know.
