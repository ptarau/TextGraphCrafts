A finite automatonthe so-called neuromaton, realized by a finite discrete recurrent neural network, working in parallel computation mode, is considered. Both the size of neuromata (i.e., the number of neurons) and their descriptional complexity (i.e., the number of bits in the neuromaton representation) are studied. It is proved that a constraint time delay of the neuromaton output does not play a role within a polynomial descriptional complexity. It is shown that any regular language given by a regular expression of length n is recognized by a neuromaton with &THgr;(n) neurons. Further, it is proved that this network size is, in the worst case, optimal. On the other hand, generally there is not an equivalent polynomial length regular     expression for a given neuromaton. Then, two specialized constructions of neural acceptors of the optimal descriptional complexity &THgr;(
