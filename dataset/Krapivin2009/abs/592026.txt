In this paper we present a mechanism for making specification-based component retrieval more efficient by limiting the amount of theorem proving required at query time. This is done by using a classification scheme to reduce the number of specification matching proofs that are required to process a query. Components are classified by assigning features that correspond to necessary conditions implied by the component specifications. We show how this method of feature assignment can be used to approximate reusability relationships between queries and library components. The set of possible classification features are formally defined, permitting automation of the classification process. The classification process itself is made efficient by using a specialized theorem proving tactic to prove feature implication. The retrieval mechanism was implemented and evaluated experimentally using a library of list manipulation components. The results indicate a better response time than existing formal approaches. The approach provides higher levels of consistency and automation than informal methods, with comparable retrieval performance.
