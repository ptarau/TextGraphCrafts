Understanding data semantics from real-life databases is  considered following an audit perspective: it must help experts to  analyse what properties actually hold in the data and support the comparison  with desired properties. This is a typical problem of knowledge discovery in  databases (KDD) and it is specified within the framework of Mannila  and Toivonen where data mining consists in querying theories e.g., the theories  of approximate inclusion dependencies. This formalization enables us to  identify an important subtask to support database audit as well as a generic  algorithm. Next, we consider the DREAM relational database reverse engineering  method and DREAM heuristics are revisited within this new setting.
