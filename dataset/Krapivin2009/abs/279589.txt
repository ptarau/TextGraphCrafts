AbstractWe propose a technique for analyzing cache-related preemption delays of tasks that cause unpredictable variation in task execution time in the context of fixed-priority preemptive scheduling. The proposed technique consists of two steps. The first step performs a per-task analysis to estimate cache-related preemption cost for each execution point in a given task. The second step computes the worst case response time of each task that includes the cache-related preemption delay using a response time equation and a linear programming technique. This step takes as its input the preemption cost information of tasks obtained in the first step. This paper also compares the proposed approach with previous approaches. The results show that the proposed approach gives a prediction of the worst case cache-related preemption delay that is up to 60 percent tighter than those obtained from the previous approaches.
