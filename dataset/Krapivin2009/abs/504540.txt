We wish to use a given nondeterministic two-way multi-tape acceptor as a transducer by supplying the contents for only some of its input tapes, and asking it to generate the missing contents for the other tapes. We provide here an algorithm for assuring beforehand that this transduction always results in a finite set of answers. We also develop an algorithm for evaluating these answers whenever the previous algorithm indicated their finiteness. Furthermore, our algorithms can be used for speeding up the simulation of these acceptors even when not used as transducers. Copyright 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
