A technique to construct a low-order finite difference preconditioner for solving orthogonal collocation equations for boundary value problems is presented.  It is shown numerically and theoretically that the spectral condition numbers of the preconditioned collocation matrices are bounded by constants independent of the number of mesh nodes when certain exact low-order finite difference preconditionings are used. Preconditioners based on incomplete LU factorization are also discussed. Numerical experiments show the efficiency and robustness of the preconditioning.
