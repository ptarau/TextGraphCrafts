AbstractCross-iterations data dependences in DOACROSS loops require explicit data synchronizations to enforce them. However, the composite effect of some data synchronizations may cover the other dependences and make the enforcement of those covered dependences redundant. In this paper, we propose an efficient and general algorithm to identify redundant synchronizations in multiply nested DOACROSS loops which may have multiple statements and loop-exit control branches. Eliminating redundant sychronizations in DOACROSS loops allows more efficient execution of such loops. We also address the issues of enforcing data synchronizations in iterations near the boundary of the iteration space. Because some dependences may not exist in those boundary iterations, it adds complexity in determining the redundant synchronizations for those boundary iterations. The necessary and sufficient condition under which the synchronization is uniformly redundant is also studied. These results allow a parallelizing compiler to generate efficient data synchronization instructions for DOACROSS loops.
