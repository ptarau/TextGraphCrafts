This paper describes the T-Ruby system for designing VLSI circuits, starting from formal specifications in which they are described in terms of relational abstractions of their behaviour. The design process involves correctness-preserving transformations based on proved equivalences between relations, together with the addition of constraints. A class of implementable relations is defined. The tool enables such relations to be simulated or translated into a circuit description in VHDL. The design process is illustrated by the derivation of a circuit for 2-dimensional convolution.
