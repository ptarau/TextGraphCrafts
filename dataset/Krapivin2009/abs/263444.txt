AbstractThis paper presents a linear algorithm for recovering 3D affine shape and motion from line correspondences with uncalibrated affine cameras. The algorithm requires a minimum of seven line correspondences over three views. The key idea is the introduction of a one-dimensional projective camera. This converts 3D affine reconstruction of "line directions" into 2D projective reconstruction of "points." In addition, a line-based factorization method is also proposed to handle redundant views. Experimental results both on simulated and real image sequences validate the robustness and the accuracy of the algorithm.
