Controlled languages are regimented fragments of natural language designed to make the processing of natural language more efficient and reliable. This paper defines a controlled language, E2V, whose principal grammatical resources include determiners, relative clauses, reflexives and pronouns. We provide a formal syntax and semantics for E2V, in which anaphoric ambiguities are resolved in a linguistically natural way. We show that the expressive power of E2V is equal to that of the two-variable fragment of first-order logic. It follows that the problem of determining the satisfiability of a set of E2V sentences is NEXPTIME complete. We show that E2V can be extended in various ways without compromising these complexity results; however, relaxing our policy on anaphora resolution renders the satisfiability problem for E2V undecidable. Finally, we argue that our results have a bearing on the broader philosophical issue of the relationship between natural and formal languages.
