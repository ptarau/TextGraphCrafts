The design and representation schemes used in constructing a prototype computational environment for modeling and simulating multiagent software engineering processes are described. This environment is called the articulator. An overview of the articulator's architecture identifying five principal components is provided. Three of the components, the knowledge metamodel, the software process behavior simulator, and a knowledge base querying mechanism, are detailed and examples are included. The conclusion reiterates what is unique to this approach in applying knowledge engineering techniques to the problems of understanding the statics and dynamics of complex software engineering processes.
