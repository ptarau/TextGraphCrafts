This paper considers the numerical stability of null-space methods for Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) systems, particularly in the context of quadratic programming. The methods we consider are based on the direct elimination of variables, which is attractive for solving large sparse systems. Ill-conditioning in a certain submatrix A in the system is shown to adversely affect the method insofar as it is commonly implemented. In particular, it can cause growth in the residual error of the solution, which would not normally occur if Gaussian elimination or related methods were used. The mechanism of this error growth is studied and is not due to growth in the null-space basis matrix Z, as might have been expected, but to the indeterminacy of this matrix. When LU factors of A are available it is shown that an alternative form of the method is available which avoids this residual error growth. These conclusions are supported by error analysis and Matlab experiments on some extremely ill-conditioned test problems. These indicate that the alternative method is very robust in regard to residual error growth and is unlikely to be significantly inferior to the methods based on an orthogonal basis matrix. The paper concludes with some discussion of what needs to be done when LU factors are not available.
