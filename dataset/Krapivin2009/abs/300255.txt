A flurry of buzzwords awaits anyone investigating database technology for decision support: data warehouse, multidimensional and dimensional database, on-line analytical processing, star schema, slicing, dicing, drill-down and roll-up. We introduce the area via an example based on a long-ago project to design a repository on energy information for the US Department of Energy. Once we have introduced some terminology, we explore research issues associated with decision-support databases, including representation, modeling, metadata, architectures and query processing. The purpose of this paper is to provide researchers with the background they need to contribute to this area.
