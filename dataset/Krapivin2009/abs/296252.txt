Each of n processors has a value which should be transmitted to all other processors. This fundamental communication task is called gossiping. In a unit of time every processor can communicate with at most one other processor and during such a transmission each member of a communicating pair learns all values currently known to the other.Two important criteria of efficiency of a gossiping algorithm are its running time and the total number of transmissions. Another measure of quality of a gossiping algorithm is the total number of links used for transmissions. This is the minimum cost of a network which can support the gossiping algorithm. We establish trade-offs between the time T of gossiping and the number C of transmissions and between the time of gossiping and the number L of links used by the algorithm. For a given T we construct gossiping algorithms working in time T, with parameters C and L close to optimal.
