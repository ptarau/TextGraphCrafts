We study jitter control in networks with guaranteed quality of service (QoS) from the competitive analysis point of view: we propose on-line algorithms that control jitter and compare their performance to the best possible (by an off-line algorithm) for any given arrival sequence. For delay jitter, where the goal is to minimize the difference between delay times of different packets, we show that a simple on-line algorithm using a buffer of B slots guarantees the same delay jitter as the best off-line algorithm using buffer space B/2. We prove that the guarantees made by our on-line algorithm hold, even for simple distributed implementations, where the total buffer space is distributed along the path of the connection, provided that the input stream satisfies a certain simple property. For rate jitter, where the goal is to minimize the difference between inter-arrival times, we develop an on-line algorithm using a buffer of size 2B + h for any h  1, and compare its jitter to the jitter of an optimal off-line algorithm using buffer size B. We prove that our algorithm guarantees that the difference is bounded by a term proportional to B/h.
