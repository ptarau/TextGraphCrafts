AbstractIn this paper, we present an algorithm that estimates dense planar-parallax motion from multiple uncalibrated views of a 3D scene. This generalizes the "plane+parallax" recovery methods to more than two frames. The parallax motion of pixels across multiple frames (relative to a planar surface) is related to the 3D scene structure and the camera epipoles. The parallax field, the epipoles, and the 3D scene structure are estimated directly from image brightness variations across multiple frames, without precomputing correspondences.
