In this paper, we consider the stochastic profile scheduling problem of a partially ordered set of tasks on uniform processors. The set of available processors varies in time. The running times of the tasks are independent random variables with exponential distributions. We obtain a sufficient condition under which a list policy stochastically minimizes the makespan within the class of preemptive policies. This result allows us to obtain a simple optimal policy when the partial order is an interval order, an in-forest, or an out-forest.
