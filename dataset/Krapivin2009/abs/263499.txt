Constraint networks are a simple representation and reasoning framework with diverse applications. In this paper, we identify two new complementary properties on the restrictiveness of the constraints in a networkconstraint tightness and constraint loosenessand we show their usefulness for estimating the level of local consistency needed to ensure global consistency, and for estimating the level of local consistency present in a network. In particular, we present a sufficient condition, based on constraint tightness and the level of local consistency, that guarantees that a solution can be found in a backtrack-free manner. The condition can be useful in applications where a knowledge base will be queried over and over and the  preprocessing costs can be amortized over many queries. We also present a sufficient condition for local consistency, based on constraint looseness, that is straightforward and inexpensive to determine. The condition can be used to estimate the level of local consistency of a network. This in turn can be used in deciding whether it would be useful to preprocess the network before a backtracking search, and in deciding which local consistency conditions, if any, still need to be enforced if we want to ensure that a solution can be found in a backtrack-free manner. Two definitions of local consistency are employed in characterizing the conditions: the traditional variable-based notion and a recently introduced definition of local consistency called relational  consistency.
