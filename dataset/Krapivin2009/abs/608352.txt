This paper studies the convergence properties of a general class of decomposition algorithms for support vector machines (SVMs). We provide a model algorithm for decomposition, and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for stepwise improvement of this algorithm. We introduce a simple rate certifying condition and prove a polynomial-time bound on the rate of convergence of the model algorithm when it satisfies this condition. Although it is not clear that existing SVM algorithms satisfy this condition, we provide a version of the model algorithm that does. For this algorithm we show that when the slack multiplier C satisfies \sqrt{1/2}  C  mL, where m is the number of samples and L is a matrix norm, then it takes no more than 4LC2m4/&epsi; iterations to drive the criterion to within &epsi; of its optimum.
