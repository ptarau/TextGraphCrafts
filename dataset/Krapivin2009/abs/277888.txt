We consider broadcast WDM networks operating with schedules that mask the transceiver tuning latency. We develop and analyze a queueing model of the network in order to obtain the queue-length distribution and the packet loss probability at the transmitting and receiving side of the nodes. The analysis is carried out assuming finite buffer sizes, non-uniform destination probabilities and two-state MMBP traffic sources; the latter naturally capture the notion of burstiness and correlation, two important characteristics of traffic in high-speed networks. We present results which establish that the performance of the network is a complex function of a number of system parameters, including the load balancing and scheduling algorithms, the number of available channels, and the buffer capacity. We also show that the behavior of the network in terms of packet loss probability as these parameters are varied cannot be predicted without an accurate analysis. Our work makes it possible to study the interactions among the system parameters, and to predict, explain and fine tune the performance of the network.
