If $A$ is a square matrix with spectral radius less than 1 then $A^k \to 0$ as $k \to \infty$, but the powers computed in finite precision arithmetic may or may not converge. We derive a sufficient condition for $fl(A^k) \to 0$ as $k\to\infty$ and a bound on $\norm{fl(A^k)}$, both expressed in terms of the Jordan canonical form of $A$. Examples show that the results can be sharp. We show that the sufficient condition can be rephrased in terms of a pseudospectrum of $A$ when $A$ is diagonalizable, under certain assumptions. Our analysis leads to the rule of thumb that convergence or divergence of the computed powers of $A$ can be expected according as the spectral radius computed by any backward stable algorithm is less than or greater than 1.
