A typical approach to estimate an unknown quantity $\mu$ is to design an experiment that produces a random variable Z, distributed in [0,1] with  E[Z]=\mu$, run this experiment independently a number of times, and use the average of the outcomes as the estimate.  In this paper, we consider the case when no a priori information about Z is known except that is distributed in [0,1].  We describe an approximation algorithm ${\cal A}{\cal A}$ which, given $\epsilon$ and $\delta$, when running independent experiments with respect to any Z, produces an estimate that is within a factor $1+\epsilon$ of $\mu$ with probability at least $1-\delta$.  We prove that the expected number of experiments run by ${\cal A}{\cal A}$ (which depends on Z) is optimal to within a constant factor {for every} Z.
