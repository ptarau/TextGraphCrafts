AbstractWe consider the problem of mining association rules on a shared-nothing multiprocessor. We present three algorithms that explore a spectrum of trade-offs between computation, communication, memory usage, synchronization, and the use of problem-specific information. The best algorithm exhibits near perfect scaleup behavior, yet requires only minimal overhead compared to the current best serial algorithm.
