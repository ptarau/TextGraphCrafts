In this paper, we claim that the disambiguation of referring expressions in discourse can be formulated in terms automated reasoners can address. Specifically, we show that consistency, informativity and minimality are criteria which (i) can be implemented using automated reasoning tools and (ii) can be used to disambiguate noun-noun compounds, metonymy and definite descriptions.
