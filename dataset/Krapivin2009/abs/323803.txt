AbstractThis paper presents an analysis of radix representations of elements from general rings; in particular, we study the questions of redundancy and completeness in such representations. Mappings into radix representations, as well as conversions between such, are discussed, in particular where the target system is redundant. Results are shown valid for normed rings containing only a finite number of elements with a bounded distance from zero, essentially assuring that the ring is discrete. With only brief references to the more usual representations of integers, the emphasis is on various complex number systems, including the classical complex number systems for the Gaussian integers, as well as the Eisenstein integers, concluding with a summary on properties of some low-radix representations of such systems.
