The object-oriented approach to system structuring has found widespread acceptanceamong designers and developers of robust computing systems. The authors propose asystem structure for distributed programming systems that support persistent objects anddescribe how properties such as persistence and recoverability can be implemented. Theproposed structure is modular, permitting easy exploitation of any distributed computingfacilities provided by the underlying system. An existing system constructed according tothe principles espoused here is examined to illustrate the practical utility of the proposedapproach to system structuring.
