The following file distribution problem is considered: Given  a network of processors represented by an undirected graph  $G=(V,E)$ and a file size $k$, an arbitrary file w  of $k$ bits is to be distributed among all nodes of $G$. To  this end, each node is assigned a memory device such that by  accessing the memory of its own and of its adjacent nodes,  the node can reconstruct the contents of w. The  objective is to minimize the total size of memory in the  network. This paper presents a file distribution scheme  which realizes this objective for $k \gg \log \Delta_G$,  where $\Delta_G$ stands for the maximum degree in $G$: For  this range of $k$, the total memory size required by the  suggested scheme approaches an integer programming lower  bound on that size. The scheme is also constructive in the  sense that given $G$ and $k$, the memory size at each node  in $G$, as well as the mapping of any file w into the  node memory devices, can be computed in time complexity  which is polynomial in $k$ and $|V|$. Furthermore, each node  can reconstruct the contents of such a file w in  $O(k^2)$ bit operations. Finally, it is shown that the  requirement of $k$ being much larger than $\log \Delta_G$ is  necessary in order to have total memory size close to the  integer programming lower bound.
