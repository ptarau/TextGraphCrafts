Rate monotonic and deadline monotonic scheduling are commonly used for periodic real-time task systems. This paper discusses a feasibility decision for a given real-time task system when the system is scheduled by rate monotonic and deadline monotonic scheduling. The time complexity of existing feasibility decision algorithms depends on both the number of tasks and maximum periods or deadlines when the periods and deadlines are integers. This paper presents a new necessary and sufficient condition for a given task system to be feasible and proposes a new feasibility decision algorithm based on that condition. The time complexity of this algorithm depends solely on the number of tasks. This condition can also be applied as a sufficient condition for a task system using priority inheritance protocols to be feasible with rate monotonic and deadline monotonic scheduling.
