Consider a single server queue with i.i.d. arrival and service  processes, \{A,\ A_n,n\geq 0\} and \{C,\ C_n,n\geq  0\}, respectively, and a finite buffer B. The queue content  process \{Q^B_n,\ n\geq 0\} is recursively defined as  Q^B_{n+1}=\min((Q^B_n+A_{n+1}-C_{n+1})^+,B),  q^+=\max(0,q). When \mathbb{E}(A-C)<0, and  A has a subexponential distribution, we show that the stationary  expected loss rate for this queue  \mathbb{E}(Q^B_n+A_{n+1}-C_{n+1}-B)^+ has the following explicit  asymptotic characterization:  \mathbb{E}(Q^B_n+A_{n+1}-C_{n+1}-B)^+\sim \mathbb{E}(A-B)^+ \quad  \hbox{as} \ B\rightarrow \infty, independently of the server process  C_n. For a fluid queue with capacity c,  M/G/\infty arrival process A_t, characterized by  intermediately regularly varying on periods \tau^{\mathrm{on}},  which arrive with Poisson rate \Lambda, the average loss rate  \lambda_{\mathrm{loss}}^B satisfies  {\lambda_{\mathrm{loss}}^B}\sim \Lambda  \mathbb{E}(\tau^{\mathrm{on}}\eta-B)^+ \quad \hbox{as}\ B\rightarrow  \infty, where \eta=r+\rho-c,   r) is the rate at which the fluid is arriving during an on period.  Accuracy of the above asymptotic relations is verified with extensive numerical  and simulation experiments. These explicit formulas have potential application  in designing communication networks that will carry traffic with  long-tailed characteristics, e.g., Internet data services.
