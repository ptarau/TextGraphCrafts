Parallel algorithms for computing sparse approximations to the inverse of a sparse matrix either use a prescribed sparsity pattern for the approximate inverse or attempt to generate a good pattern as part of the algorithm.  This paper demonstrates that, for PDE problems, the patterns of powers of sparsified matrices (PSMs) can be used a priori as effective approximate inverse patterns, and that the additional effort of  adaptive sparsity pattern calculations may not be required.  PSM patterns are related to various other approximate inverse sparsity patterns through matrix graph theory and heuristics concerning the PDE's Green's function.  A parallel implementation shows that PSM-patterned approximate inverses are significantly faster to construct than approximate inverses constructed adaptively, while often giving preconditioners of comparable quality.
