Recent research in value prediction shows a surprising amount of predictability for the values produced by register-writing instructions. Several hardware based value predictor designs have been proposed to exploit this predictability by eliminating flow dependencies for highly predictable values. This paper proposed a hardware and software based scheme for value speculation scheduling (VSS). Static VLIW scheduling techniques are used to speculate value dependent instructions by scheduling them above the instructions whose results they are dependent on. Prediction hardware is used to provide value predictions for allowing the execution of speculated instructions to continue. In the case of miss-predicted values, control flow is redirected to patch-up code so that execution can proceed with the correct results. In this paper, experiments in VSS for load operations in the SPECint95 benchmarks are performed. Speedup of up to 17% has been shown for using VSS. Empirical results on the value predictability of loads, based on value profiling data, are also provided.
