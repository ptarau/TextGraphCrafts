We present a new method to represent variable bindings in the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM), so that the ages of variable bindings can be easily found using this new representation in our intelligent backtracking schema. The age of a variable bound to a non-variable term is the youngest choice point such that backtracking to that choice point can make that variable an unbound variable again. The procedure backtracking point is the choice point of the procedure currently being executed or the choice point of its first ancestor having a choice point. Variable ages and procedure backtracking points are used in the process of figuring out backtracking points in our intelligent backtracking schema. Our intelligent backtracking schema performs much better than the results of other intelligent backtracking methods in the literature for deterministic programs, and its performance for non-deterministic programs are comparable with their results.
