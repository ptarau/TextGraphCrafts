This paper describes OneChip, a third generation reconfigurable processor architecture that integrates a Reconfigurable Functional Unit (RFU) into a superscalar Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) processor's pipeline. The architecture allows dynamic scheduling and dynamic reconfiguration. It also provides support for pre-loading configurations and for Least Recently Used (LRU) configuration management.To evaluate the performance of the OneChip architecture, several off-the-shelf software applications were compiled and executed on Sim-OneChip, an architecture simulator for OneChip that includes a software environment for programming the system. The architecture is compared to a similar one but without dynamic scheduling and without an RFU. OneChip achieves a performance improvement and shows a speedup range from 2.16 up to 32 for the different applications and data sizes used. The results show that dynamic scheduling helps performance the most on average, and that the RFU will always improve performance the best when most of the execution is in the RFU.
