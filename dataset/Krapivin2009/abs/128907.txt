Previous work on superimposed coding has been characterized by two aspects. First, it is generally assumed that signatures are generated from logical text blocks of the same size; that is, each block contains the same number of unique terms after stopword and duplicate removal. We call this approach the fixed-size block (FSB) method, since each text block has the same size, as measured by the number of unique terms contained in it. Second, with only a few exceptions [6,7,8,9,17], most previous work has assumed that each term in the text contributes the same number of ones to the signature (i.e., the weight of the term signatures is fixed). The main objective of this paper is to derive an optimal weight assignment that assigns weights to document terms according to  their occurrence and query frequencies in order to minimize the false-drop probability. The optimal scheme can account for both uniform and nonuniform occurence and query frequencies, and the signature generation method is still based on hashing rather than on table lookup. Furthermore, a new way of generating signatures, the fixed-weight block (FWB) method, is introduced. FWB controls the weight of every signature to a constant, whereas in FSB, only the expected signature weight is constant. We have shown that FWB has a lower false-drop probability than that of the FSB method, but its storage overhead is slightly  higher. Other advantages of FWB are that the optimal weight assignment can be obtained analytically without making unrealistic assumptions and that the formula for computing the term signature weights is simple and efficient.
