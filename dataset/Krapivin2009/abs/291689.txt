A Coxeter group element w is fully commutative if any reduced expression for w can be obtained from any other via the interchange of commuting generators. For example, in the symmetric group of degree n, the number of fully commutative elements is the nth Catalan number. The Coxeter groups with finitely many fully commutative elements can be arranged into seven infinite families A_n, B_n, D_n, E_n, F_n, H_n and I_2(m). For each family, we provide explicit generating functions for the number of fully commutative elements and the number of fully commutative involutions; in each case, the generating function is algebraic.
