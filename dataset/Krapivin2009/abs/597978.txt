In this paper a fluid approximation, also known as a functional  strong law of large numbers (FSLLN) for a GI/G/1 queue  under a processor-sharing service discipline is established and its  properties are analysed. The fluid limit depends on the arrival rate, the  service time distribution of the initial customers, and the service time  distribution of the arriving customers. This is in contrast to the known result  for the GI/G/1 queue under a FIFO service discipline, where the  fluid limit is piecewise linear and depends on the service time distribution  only through its mean. The piecewise linear form of the limit can be recovered  by an equilibrium type choice of the initial service distribution.
