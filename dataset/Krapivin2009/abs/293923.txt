In this paper, we investigate quasi-invariance on a smooth manifold, and show that there exist quasi-invariant parameterisations which are not exactly invariant but approximately invariant under group transformations and do not require high order derivatives. The affine quasi-invariant parameterisation is investigated in more detail and exploited for defining general affine semi-local invariants from second order derivatives only. The new invariants are implemented and used for matching curve segments under general affine motions and extracting symmetry axes of objects with 3D bilateral symmetry.
