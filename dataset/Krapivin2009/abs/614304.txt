AbstractCurves in space are difficult to perceive and analyze, especially when they form dense sets as in typical 3D flow and volume deformation applications. We propose a technique that exposes essential properties of space curves by attaching an appropriate moving coordinate frame to each point, reexpressing that moving frame as a unit quaternion, and supporting interaction with the resulting quaternion field. The original curves in three-space are associated with piecewise continuous four-vector quaternion fields, which map into new curves lying in the unit three-sphere in four-space. Since four-space clusters of curves with similar moving frames occur independently of the curves original proximity in three-space, a powerful analysis tool results. We treat two separate moving-frame formalisms, the Frenet frame and the parallel-transport frame, and compare their properties. We describe several flexible approaches for interacting with and exploiting the properties of the four-dimensional quaternion fields.
