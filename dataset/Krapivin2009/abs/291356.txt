The definition of generalized Hamming weights (GHW) for linear codes over Galois rings is discussed. The properties of GHW for Galois ring linear codes are stated. Upper and existence bounds for GHW of ZF_4 linear codes and a lower bound for GHW of the Kerdock code over Z_4 are derived. GHW of some ZF_4 linear codes are determined.
