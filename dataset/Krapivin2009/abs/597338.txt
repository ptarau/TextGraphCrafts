Modern electronic commerce environments are heavily web-based  and involve issues such as distributed execution, multiuser interactive access  or interface with and use of middleware platforms. Thus, their components  exhibit the properties of communication, cooperation and coordination as in  CSCW, groupware or workflow management systems. In this paper we examine the  potential of using coordination technology to model electronic commerce  activities and we show the benefits of such an approach. Furthermore, we argue  that control-oriented, event-driven coordination models (which  enjoy some inherent properties such as security) are more suitable for  electronic commerce than data-driven ones which are based on accessing an  open shared communication medium in almost unrestricted ways.
