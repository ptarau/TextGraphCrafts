In this paper, we extend the work of Chen and Zhang [12] and establish a new sufficient condition for the existence of the (conventional) diffusion approximation for multiclass queueing networks under priority service disciplines. This sufficient condition relates to the weak stability of the fluid networks and the stability of the high priority classes of the fluid networks that correspond to the queueing networks under consideration. Using this sufficient condition, we prove the existence of the diffusion approximation for the last-buffer-first-served reentrant lines. We also study a three-station network example, and observe that the diffusion approximation may not  exist, even if the proposed limiting semimartingale reflected Brownian motion (SRBM) exists.
