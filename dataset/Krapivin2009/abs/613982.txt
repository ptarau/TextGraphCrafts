IBM has recently launched an upgrade of the communication subsystem of its SP2 parallel computer. This change affects both hardware and software elements: high-performance switch, message interface adapters, and a new implementation of the MPI message-passing library. To characterize to what extent these changes will affect the execution times of parallel applications, these authors have run a collection of benchmarks on a SP2 with the old communication subsystem and on the same machine after upgrade. These benchmarks include point-to-point and collective communication tests as well as a set of complete parallel applications. The performance indicators are the latency and throughput exhibited by the basic communication tests and the execution time in the case of real applications. Result indicate that only under certain circumstances does a significant performance increase result.
