Abstract: To construct complete systems on silicon, application specific DSP accelerators are needed to speed up the execution of high throughput DSP algorithms. In this paper, a methodology is presented to synthesize high throughput DSP functions into accelerator processors containing a datapath of highly pipelined, bit-parallel hardware units. Emphasis is put on the definition of a controller architecture that allows efficient run-time schedules of these DSP algorithms on such highly pipelined data paths. The methodology is illustrated by means of an FFT butterfly accelerator block.
