Genetic algorithms are adaptive methods based on natural evolution that may be used for search and optimization problems. They process a population of search space solutions with three operations: selection, crossover, and mutation. Under their initial formulation, the search space solutions are coded using the binary alphabet, however other coding types have been taken into account for the representation issue, such as real coding. The real-coding approach seems particularly natural when tackling optimization problems of parameters with variables in continuous domains.A problem in the use of genetic algorithms is premature convergence, a premature stagnation of the search caused by the lack of population diversity. The mutation operator is the one responsible for the generation of diversity and therefore may be considered to be an important element in solving this problem. For the case of working under real coding, a solution involves the control, throughout the run, of the strength in which real genes are mutated, i.e., the step size.This paper presents TRAMSS, a Two-loop Real-coded genetic algorithm with Adaptive control of Mutation Step Sizes. It adjusts the step size of a mutation operator applied during the inner loop, for producing efficient local tuning. It also controls the step size of a mutation operator used by a restart operator performed in the outer loop, for reinitializing the population in order to ensure that different promising search zones are focused by the inner loop throughout the run. Experimental results show that the proposal consistently outperforms other mechanisms presented for controlling mutation step sizes, offering two main advantages simultaneously, better reliability and accuracy.
