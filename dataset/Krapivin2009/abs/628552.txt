This paper concerns the robustness of local phase information for measuring image velocity and binocular disparity. It addresses the dependence of phase behavior on the initial filters as well as the image variations that exist between different views of a 3D scene. We are particularly interested in the stability of phase with respect to geometric deformations, and its linearity as a function of spatial position. These properties are important to the use of phase information, and are shown to depend on the form of the filters as well as their frequency bandwidths. Phase instabilities are also discussed using the model of phase singularities described by Jepson and Fleet. In addition to phase-based methods, these results are directly relevant to differential optical flow methods and zero-crossing tracking.
