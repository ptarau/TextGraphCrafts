Formal Synthesis is a methodology developed at the university of Kent for combining circuit design and verification, where a circuit is constructed from a proof that it meets a given formal specification. We have reinterpreted this methodology in ISABELLES theory of higher-order logic so that circuits are incrementally built during proofs using higher-order resolution. Our interpretation simplifies and extends Formal Synthesis both conceptually and in implementation. It also supports integration of this development style with other proof-based synthesis methodologies and leads to techniques for developing new classes of circuits, e.g., recursive descriptions of parametric designs.
