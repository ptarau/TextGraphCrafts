We establish a correspondence between temporal logic and a subset of ATSQL, a temporal extension of SQL-92. In addition, we provide an effective translation from temporal logic to ATSQL that enables a user to write high-level queries which are then evaluated against a space-efficient representation of the database. A reverse translation, also provided in this paper, characterizes the expressive power of a syntactically defined subset of ATSQL queries.
