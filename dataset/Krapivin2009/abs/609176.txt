We study the continuation passing style (CPS) transform and its generalization, the computational transform, in which the notion of computation is generalized from continuation passing to an arbitrary one. To establish a relation between direct style and continuation passing style interpretation of sequential call-by-value programs, we prove the Retraction Theorem which says that a lambda term can be recovered from its CPS form via a -definable retraction. The Retraction Theorem is proved in the logic of computational lambda calculus for the simply typable terms.
