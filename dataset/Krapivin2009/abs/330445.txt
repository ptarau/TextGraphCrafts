AbstractIn this paper, we study distributed path reservation protocols for multiplexed all-optical interconnection networks. The path reservation protocols negotiate the reservation and establishment of connections that arrive dynamically to the network. These protocols can be applied to both wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and time division multiplexing (TDM) networks. Two classes of protocols are discussed: forward reservation protocols and backward reservation protocols. Simulations of multiplexed two-dimensional torus interconnection networks are used to evaluate and compare the performance of the protocols and to study the impact of system parameters, such as the multiplexing degree and the network size, speed, and load, on both network throughput and communication delay. The simulation results show that, in most cases, the backward reservation schemes provide better performance than their forward reservation counterparts.
