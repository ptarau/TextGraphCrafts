We describe the spectra and pseudospectra of continuous time and discrete time waveform relaxation operators.  Since the spectrum of the finite-interval waveform relaxation operator is only a singleton, the spectrum of the infinite-interval operator is typically used to describe the behavior of waveform relaxation algorithms.  Here, we show that the pseudospectrum is a more useful tool for analyzing convergence of waveform iterations on finite intervals and prove that the pseudospectrum of the infinite-interval operator is in fact the limit of the pseudospectra of the finite-interval operators.
