An ad hoc wireless network is an autonomous self-organizing system ofmobile nodes connected by wireless links where nodes not in directrange can communicate via intermediate nodes. A common technique usedin routing protocols for ad hoc wireless networks is to establish therouting paths on-demand, as opposed to continually maintaining acomplete routing table. A significant concern in routing is theability to function in the presence of byzantine failures whichinclude nodes that drop, modify, or mis-route packets in an attempt todisrupt the routing service.We propose an on-demand routing protocol for ad hoc wireless networks that provides resilience to byzantine failures caused by individual or colluding nodes. Our adaptive probing technique detects a malicious link after log n faults have occurred, where n is the length of the path. These links are then avoided by multiplicatively increasing their weights and by using an on-demand route discovery protocol that finds a least weight path to the destination.
