Defining information required by automatic test systems frequently involves a description of system behavior. To facilitate capturing the required behavior information in the context of testing, a formal model of behavior was developed for use by test systems. The approach taken in defining the behavior model was based on information modeling and was derived from recent work in formal methods by the hardware and software design communities. Specifically, an information model was developed in EXPRESS capturing the relationships between essential entities characterizing behavior. In this paper, we provide a high level description of the behavior information model and several examples applying the model in a test environment.
