In this paper, we describe a general approach to scaling data mining applications that we have come to call meta-learning. Meta-Learning refers to a general strategy that seeks to learn how to combine a number of separate learning processes in an intelligent fashion. We desire a meta-learning architecture that exhibits two key behaviors. First, the meta-learning strategy must produce an accurate final classification system. This means that a meta-learning architecture must produce a final outcome that is at least as accurate as a conventional learning algorithm applied to all available data. Second, it must be fast, relative to an individual sequential learning algorithm when applied to massive databases of examples, and operate in a reasonable amount of time. This paper focussed primarily on issues related to the accuracy and efficacy of meta-learning as a general strategy. A number of empirical results are presented demonstrating that meta-learning is technically feasible in wide-area, network computing environments.
