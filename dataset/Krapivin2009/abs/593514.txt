In the form of the support vector machine and Gaussian processes, kernel-based systems are currently very popular approaches to supervised learning. Unfortunately, the computational load for training kernel-based systems increases drastically with the size of the training data set, such that these systems are not ideal candidates for applications with large data sets. Nevertheless, research in this direction is very active. In this paper, I review some of the current approaches toward scaling kernel-based systems to large data sets.
