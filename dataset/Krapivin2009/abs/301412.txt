A theoretically justifiable fast finite successive linear approximation algorithm is proposed for obtaining a parsimonious solutionto a corrupted linear system Ax=b+p, where the corruptionp is due to noise or error in measurement. The proposedlinear-programming-based algorithm finds a solutionx by parametrically minimizing the number of nonzeroelements in x and the error &Verbar;Ax-b-p&Verbar;_1.Numerical tests on a signal-processing-based exampleindicate that the proposed method is comparable to a method that parametrically minimizesthe1 -norm of the solution x and the error &Verbar;Ax-b-p&Verbar;_1, and that both methods are superior, byorders of magnitude, to solutions obtained by least squares as well by combinatorially choosing an optimal solution with a specific number of nonzero elements.
