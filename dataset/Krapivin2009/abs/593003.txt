We consider the problem of routing in a wide area mobile ad hoc network called Network. Routing in this network is designed with the following objectives. First, it should scale well in terms of the number of nodes and geographical coverage; second, routing should have scalable mechanisms that cope with the dynamicity in the network due to mobility; and third, nodes need to be highly collaborative and redundant, but, most of all, cannot use complex algorithms or protocols. Our routing scheme is a combination of two protocols called Routing (TLR) and Terminode Remote Routing (TRR). TLR is used to route packets to close destinations. TRR is used to route to remote destinations. The combination of TLR and TRR has the following features: (1) it is highly scalable because every node relies only on itself and a small number of other nodes for packet forwarding; (2) it acts and reacts well to the dynamicity of the network because as a rule multipath routing is considered; and (3) it can be implemented and run in very simple devices because the algorithms and protocols are very simple and based on high collaboration. We performed simulations of the TLR and TRR protocols using the GloMoSim simulator. The simulation results for a large, highly mobile ad hoc environment demonstrate benefits of the combination of TLR and TRR over an existing protocol that uses geographical information for packet forwarding.
