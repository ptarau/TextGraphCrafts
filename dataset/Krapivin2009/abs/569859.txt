A characteristic that many emerging technologies and interaction techniques have in common is a shift towards tighter coupling between human and computer. In addition to traditional discrete interaction, more continuous interaction techniques, such as gesture recognition, haptic feedback and animation, play an increasingly important role. Additionally, many supervisory control systems (such as flight deck systems) already have a strong continuous element. The complexity of these systems and the need for rigorous analysis of the human factors involved in their operation leads us to examine formal and possibly automated support for their analysis. The fact that these systems have important temporal aspects and potentially involve continuous variables, besides discrete events, motivates the application of hybrid systems modelling, which has the expressive power to encompass these issues. Essentially, we are concerned with human-factors related questions whose answers are dependent on interactions between the user and a complex, dynamic system.In this paper we explore the use of hybrid automata, a formalism for hybrid systems, for the specification and analysis of interactive systems. To illustrate the approach we apply it to the analysis of an existing flight deck instrument for monitoring and controlling the hydraulics subsystem.
