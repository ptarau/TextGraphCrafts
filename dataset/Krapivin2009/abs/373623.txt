``Customer Retention'' is an increasingly pressing issue in  today's ever-competitive commercial arena. This is especially relevant  and important for sales and services related industries. Motivated by a  real-world problem faced by a large company, we proposed a solution that  integrates various techniques of data mining, such as feature  selection via induction, deviation analysis, and mining multiple  concept-level association rules to form an intuitive and novel approach  to gauging customer loyalty and predicting their likelihood of  defection. Immediate action triggered by these ``early-warnings''  resulting from data mining is often the key to eventual customer  retention.
