The <i>crossing number</i> cr(<i>G</i>) of a graph <i>G</i> is the minimum possible number of edge crossings in a drawing of <i>G</i> in the plane, while the <i>pair-crossing number</i> pcr(<i>G</i>) is the smallest number of pairs of edges that cross in a drawing of <i>G</i> in the plane. While cr(<i>G</i>)  pcr(<i>G</i>) holds trivially, it is not known whether a strict inequality can ever occur (this question was raised by Mohar and Pach and Tth). We aim at bounding cr(<i>G</i>) in terms of pcr(<i>G</i>). Using the methods of Leighton and Rao, Bhatt and Leighton, and Even, Guha and Schieber, we prove that One of the main steps is an analogy of the well-known lower bound cr(<i>G</i>) = (<i>b</i>(<i>G</i>)<sup>2</sup>) - <i>O</i>(ssqd(<i>G</i>)), where <i>b(G)</i> is the <i>bisection width</i> of <i>G</i>, that is, the smallest number of edges that have to be removed so that no component of the resulting graph has more than 2/3 <i>n</i> vertices. We show that We also prove by similar methods that a graph <i>G</i> with crossing number log<sup>2</sup> <i>n</i> has a nonplanar subgraph on at most <i>O</i>(<i>nm</i> log<sup>2</sup> <i>n</i>/<i>k</i>) vertices, where <i>m</i> is the number of edges,  is the maximum degree in <i>G</i>, and <i>C</i> is a suitable sufficiently large constant.
