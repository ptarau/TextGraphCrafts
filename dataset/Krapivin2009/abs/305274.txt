Within a linear algebraic framework, we present a new characterization of the class of nonlinear systems which are equivalent to a prime system.  We then introduce a class of generalized output transformations that can be thought of as a generalization to the nonlinear setting of a unimodular transformation in the output space. Our main result gives necessary and sufficient conditions for equivalence to a prime system under a certain group of transformations that includes generalized output transformations.
