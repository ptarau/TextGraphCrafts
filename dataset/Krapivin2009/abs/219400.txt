We consider the following problem: given a labelled directed graph $G$  and a regular expression $R$, find all pairs of nodes connected by a  simple path such that the concatenation of the labels along the path  satisfies $R$. The problem is motivated by the observation that many  recursive queries in relational databases can be expressed in this  form, and by the implementation of a query language, ${\bf G}^+$, based on  this observation.  We show that the problem is in general intractable,  but present an algorithm than runs in polynomial time in the size of  the graph when the regular expression and the graph are free of   conflicts.  We also present a class of languages whose expressions  can always be evaluated in time polynomial in the size of both the  graph and the expression, and characterize syntactically the  expressions for such languages.
