Jones optimality tells us that a program specializer is strong enough to remove an entire level of self-interpretation. We show that Jones optimality, which was originally aimed at the Futamura projections, plays an important role in binding-time improvements. The main results show that, regardless of the binding-time improvements which we apply to a source program, no matter how extensively, a specializer that is not Jones-optimal is strictly weaker than a specializer which is Jones optimal. By viewing a binding-time improver as a generating extension of a self-interpreter, we can connect our results with previous work on the interpretive approach.
