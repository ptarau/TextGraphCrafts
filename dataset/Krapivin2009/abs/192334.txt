Character User Interfaces (CUI) generally display only pieces of text and semi-graphical objects, whereas Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) display interaction objects (IO) such as icons, check boxes, list boxes, radio buttons and push buttons. Traditional GUI do not often go beyond such existing IO. Multimedia GUI add interactive objects such as pictures, images, video sequences that could serve as a base for sophisticated user interaction. All these types of user interfaces have in common the problem of determining a basic layout of IO. The complexity of this problem is proportional to the variety of IO accessible for the designer. This paper summarises visual techniques exported from the area of visual design to be further exploited for user interface. These visual techniques  provide the designer a wide range of means for laying out IO. A small set of guidelines for effectively applying these visual techniques is given.
