In the early studies on graph searching a graph was considered as a system of tunnels in which a fast and clever fugitive is hidden. The "classical" search  problem is to  find a search plan using the minimal number of searchers. In this paper, we consider a new criterion of optimization, namely, the search cost. First, we prove  monotone properties of searching with the smallest cost. Then, making use of  monotone properties, we prove that for any graph G the search cost of G is equal to the smallest number of edges of all interval supergraphs of G. Finally, we show how to compute the search cost of a cograph   and the corresponding search strategy in linear time.
