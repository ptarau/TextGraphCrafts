In this paper we consider the problem of minimizing a (possibly nonconvex) quadratic function with a quadratic constraint. We point out some new  properties of the problem. In particular, in the first part of the paper, we show that (i) given a KKT point that is not a global minimizer, it is easy to find a "better" feasible point; (ii) strict complementarity holds at the local-nonglobal minimizer. In the second part of this paper, we show that the original constrained problem is equivalent to the unconstrained minimization of a piecewise quartic merit function. Using the unconstrained formulation we give, in the nonconvex case, a new second order necessary condition for global minimizers. In the third part of this paper, algorithmic applications of the preceding results are briefly outlined and some preliminary numerical experiments are reported.
