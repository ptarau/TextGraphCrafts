AbstractThis paper presents a person identification system based on acoustic and visual features. The system is organized as a set of non-homogeneous classifiers whose outputs are integrated after a normalization step. In particular, two classifiers based on acoustic features and three based on visual ones provide data for an integration module whose performance is evaluated. A novel technique for the integration of multiple classifiers at an hybrid rank/measurement level is introduced using HyperBF networks. Two different methods for the rejection of an unknown person are introduced. The performance of the integrated system is shown to be superior to that of the acoustic and visual subsystems. The resulting identification system can be used to log personal access and, with minor modifications, as an identity verification system.
