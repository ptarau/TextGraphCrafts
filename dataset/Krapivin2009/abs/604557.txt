We show that $\lim_{n\to\infty}\hat r(F_{1,n},\dots,F_{q,n},F_{q+1},\dots,F_{r})/n$ exists, where the bipartite graphs $F_{q+1},\dots,F_r$ do not depend on $n$ while, for $1\le i\le q$, $F_{i,n}$ is obtained from some bipartite graph $F_i$ with parts $V_1\cup V_2=V(F_i)$ by duplicating each vertex $v\in V_2$ $(c_v+o(1))n$ times for some real $c_v>0$.In fact, the limit is the minimum of a certain mixed integer program. Using the Farkas lemma we show how to compute it when each forbidden graph is a complete bipartite graph, in particular answering the question of Erdos, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp [Period.\ Math.\ Hungar., 9 (1978), pp. 145--161], who asked for the asymptotics of $\hat r(K_{s,n},K_{s,n})$ for fixed $s$ and large $n$. Also, we prove (for all sufficiently large $n$) the conjecture of Faudree, Rousseau, and Sheehan in [Graph Theory and Combinatorics, B. Bollobas, ed., Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1984, pp. 273--281] that $\hat r(K_{2,n},K_{2,n}) =18n-15$.
