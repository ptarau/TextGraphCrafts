We present algorithms for the symbolic and numerical factorization phases in the direct solution of sparse unsymmetric systems of linear equations. We have modified a classical symbolic factorization algorithm for unsymmetric matrices to inexpensively compute minimal elimination structures.   We give an efficient algorithm to compute a near-minimal data-dependency graph for unsymmetric multifrontal factorization that is valid irrespective of the amount of dynamic pivoting performed during factorization.  Finally, we describe an unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal algorithm for Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting  that uses the task- and data-dependency graphs computed during the symbolic phase. These algorithms have been implemented in WSMP---an industrial strength sparse solver package---and have enabled WSMP to significantly outperform other similar solvers.  We present experimental results to demonstrate the merits of the new algorithms.
