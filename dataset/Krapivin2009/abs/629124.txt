Dynamic page placement policies for NUMA (nonuniform memory access time)shared-memory architectures are explored using two approaches that complement eachother in important ways. The authors measure the performance of parallel programsrunning on the experimental DUnX operating system kernel for the BBN GP1000, whichsupports a highly parameterized dynamic page placement policy. They also develop andapply an analytic model of memory system performance of a local/remote NUMAarchitecture based on approximate mean-value analysis techniques. The model isvalidated against experimental data obtained with DUnX while running a syntheticworkload. The results of this validation show that, in general, model predictions are quitegood. Experiments investigating the effectiveness of dynamic page-placement and, inparticular, dynamic multiple-copy page placement the cost of replication/coherency faulterrors, and the cost of errors in deciding whether a page should move or be remotelyreferenced are described.
