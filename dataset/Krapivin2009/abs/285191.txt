We attach a graph to every Steiner triple system. The chromatic number of this graph is related to the possibility of extending the triple system to a quadruple system. For example, the triple systems with chromatic number one are precisely the classical systems of points and lines of a projective geometry over the two-element field, the Hall triple systems have chromatic number three (and, as is well-known, are extendable) and all Steiner triple systems whose graph has chromatic number two are extendable. We also give a configurational characterization of the Hall triple systems in terms of mitres.
