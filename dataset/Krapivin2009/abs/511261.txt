This paper discusses computational complexity of conceptual successive convex relaxation methods proposed by Kojima and Tunel for approximating a convex relaxation of a compact subsetof the n-dimensional Euclidean spaceR n . Here,C0 denotes a nonempty compact convex subset ofR n , anda set of finitely or infinitely many quadratic functions. We evaluate the number of iterations which the successive convex relaxation methods require to attain a convex relaxation ofF with a given accuracy e, in terms of e, the diameter ofC0, the diameter ofF, and some other quantities characterizing the Lipschitz continuity, the nonlinearity, and the nonconvexity of the setof quadratic functions.
