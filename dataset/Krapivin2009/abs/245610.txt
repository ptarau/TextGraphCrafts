AbstractThis paper discusses detection of global predicates in a distributed program. A run of a distributed program results in a set of sequential traces, one for each process. These traces may be combined to form many global sequences consistent with the single run of the program. A strong global predicate is true in a run if it is true for all global sequences consistent with the run. We present algorithms which detect if the given strong global predicate became true in a run of a distributed program. Our algorithms can be executed on line as well as off line. Moreover, our algorithms do not assume that underlying channels satisfy FIFO ordering.
