A parallel preconditioner is presented for the solution of general sparse linear systems of equations. A sparse approximate inverse is computed explicitly and then applied as a preconditioner to an iterative method. The computation of the preconditioner is inherently parallel, and its application only requires a matrix-vector product. The sparsity pattern of the approximate inverse is not imposed a priori but captured automatically. This keeps the amount of work and the number of nonzero entries in the preconditioner to a minimum. Rigorous bounds on the clustering of the eigenvalues and the singular values are derived for the preconditioned system, and the proximity of the approximate to the true inverse is estimated. An extensive set of test problems from scientific and industrial applications provides convincing evidence of the effectiveness of this approach.
