AbstractAn approach to sensor configuration, installation, and activation for real-time monitoring of broadband networks for managing its performance is presented. An objective-driven measurement strategy for establishing the dynamic and statistical databases of the network is described. Objective driven monitoring allows the activation of sensors for data collection and abstraction based on a set of objectives. The objectives are derived from the quality of service requirements for real-time traffic control and operator submitted queries. The methodology of objective-driven monitoring for selective activation of sensors is implemented as a set of rules in the knowledge base of the monitor.
