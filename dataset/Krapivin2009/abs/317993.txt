In this paper, we have proposed efficient admission control algorithms for multimedia storage servers that are providers of variable-bit-rate media streams. The proposed schemes are based on a slicing technique and use aggressive methods for admission control. We have developed two types of admission control schemes: <i>Future-Max</i> (FM) and <i>Interval Estimation</i> (IE). The FM algorithm uses the maximum bandwidth requirement of the future to estimate the bandwidth requirement. The IE algorithm defines a class of admission control schemes that use a combination of the maximum and average bandwidths within each interval to estimate the bandwidth requirement of the interval. The performance evaluations done through simulations show that the server utilization is improved by using the FM and IE algorithms. Furthermore, the quality of service is also improved by using the FM and IE algorithms. Several results depicting the trade-off between the implementation complexity, the desired accuracy, the number of accepted requests, and the quality of service are presented.
