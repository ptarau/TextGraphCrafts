In 1980 Monien and Speckenmeyer proved that satisfiability of a propositional formula consisting of i>K clauses (of arbitrary length) can be checked in time of the order 2i>K / 3. Recently Kullmann and Luckhardt proved the worst-case upper bound 2i>L / 9, where i>L is the length of the input formula. The algorithms leading to these bounds are based on the i>splitting method, which goes back to the DavisPutnam procedure. i>Transformation rules (pure literal elimination, unit propagation, etc.) constitute a substantial part of this method. In this paper we present a new transformation rule and two algorithms using this rule. We prove that these algorithms have the worst-case upper bounds 20. 30897 i>K and 20. 10299 i>L, respectively.
