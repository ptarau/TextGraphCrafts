This paper describes a technique for approximating sounds that are generated by the motions of solid objects. The technique builds on previous work in the field of physically based animation that uses deformable models to simulate the behavior of the solid objects. As the motions of the objects are computed, their surfaces are analyzed to determine how the motion will induce acoustic pressure waves in the surrounding medium. Our technique computes the propagation of those waves to the listener and then uses the results to generate sounds corresponding to the behavior of the simulated objects.
