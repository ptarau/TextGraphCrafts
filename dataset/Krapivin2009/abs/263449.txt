AbstractMany strategies in computer vision assume the existence of general purpose models that can be used to characterize a scene or environment at various levels of abstraction. The usual assumptions are that a selected model is competent to describe a particular attribute and that the parameters of this model can be estimated by interpreting the input data in an appropriate manner (e.g., location of lines and edges, segmentation into parts or regions, etc.). This paper considers the problem of how to determine when those assumptions break down. The traditional approach is to use statistical misfit measures based on an assumed sensor noise model. The problem is that correct operation often depends critically on the correctness of the noise model. Instead, we show how this can be accomplished with a minimum of a priori knowledge and within the framework of an active approach which builds a description of environment structure and noise over several viewpoints.
