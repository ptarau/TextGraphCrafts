Detailed location information of mobile objects, for example that of a user with a mobile computer or phone, is an important input for many location-aware applications. However, constantly updating the location information for thousands of mobile objects is not feasible. Therefore, special update protocols for location information are required that transmit the information as efficiently as possible, that is requiring only few update messages, while still being effective in returning the location information with the desired accuracy. Different classes of such update protocols are described in this paper and a new combined protocol is proposed. To be able to compare their effectiveness and efficiency, we present an analysis for the minimum and average resulting accuracy of the location information in comparison with the number of messages transmitted. We also present the results of simulations that we have performed to back up our analysis.
