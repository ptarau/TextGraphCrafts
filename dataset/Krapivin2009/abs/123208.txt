A multiorder routing strategy is developed which is loop-free even in the presence of link/node failures. Unlike most conventional methods in which the same routing strategy is applied indiscriminately to all nodes in the network, nodes under this proposal may adopt different routing strategies according to the network structure. Formulas are developed to determine the minimal order of routing strategy for each node to eliminate looping completely. A systematic procedure for striking a compromise between the operational overhead and network adaptability is proposed. Several illustrative examples are presented.
