AbstractAs microprocessor speeds continue to outpace memory subsystems in speed, minimizing average data access time grows in importance. Multilateral caches afford an opportunity to reduce the average data access time by active management of block allocation and replacement decisions. We evaluate and compare the performance of traditional caches and multilateral caches with three active block allocation schemes: MAT, NTS, and PCS. We also compare the performance of NTS and PCS to multilateral caches with a near-optimal, but nonimplementable policy, pseudo-opt, that employs future knowledge to achieve both active allocation and active replacement. NTS and PCS are evaluated relative to pseudo-opt with respect to miss ratio, accuracy of predicting reference locality, actual usage accuracy, and tour lengths of blocks in the cache. Results show the multilateral schemes do outperform traditional cache management schemes, but fall short of pseudo-opt; increasing their prediction accuracy and incorporating active replacement decisions would allow them to more closely approach pseudo-opt performance.
