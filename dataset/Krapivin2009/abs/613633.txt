Currently, Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are used to name and access Web-based resources. However, URLs pose a significant scalability problem because they cannot be used to refer to replicated Web pages. The authors propose a new URI scheme called Human-Friendly Names (HFNs) to solve this scalability problem. HFNs are high-level names that are easy-to-use by humans and name Web resources in a location-independent way. This article describes a scalable HFN-to-URL resolution mechanism that is based on URNs and makes use of the Domain Name System (DNS) and the Globe Location Service.
