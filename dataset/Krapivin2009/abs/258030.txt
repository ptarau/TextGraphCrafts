Analyses based on Symmetric Daubechies Wavelets (SDW) lead to complex-valued multiresolution representations of real signals. After a recall of the construction of the SDW, we present some specific properties of these new types of Daubechies wavelets. We then discuss two applications in image processing: enhancement and restoration. In both cases, the efficiency of this multiscale representation relies on the information encoded in the phase of the complex wavelet coefficients.
