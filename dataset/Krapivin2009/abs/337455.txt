This paper addresses the issue of how to perform architectural analysis on an existing product line architecture. The con tribution of the paper is to identify and demonstrate a repeatable product line architecture analysis process. The approach defines a good product line architecture in terms of those quality attributes required by the particular product line under development. It then analyzes the architecture against these criteria by both manual and tool-supported methods. The phased approach described in this paper provides a structured analysis of an existing product line architecture using (1) formal specification of the high-level architecture, (2) manual analysis of scenarios to exercise the architecture's support for required variabilities, and (3) model checking of critical behaviors at the architectural level that are required for all systems in the product line. Results of an application to a software product line of spaceborne telescopes are used to explain and evaluate the approach.
