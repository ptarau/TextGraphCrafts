We examine the optimal control of stationary thermally convected fluid flows from the theoretical and numerical point of view.  We use thermal convection as control mechanism; that is, control is effected through the temperature on part of the boundary.  Control problems are formulated as constrained minimization problems. Existence of optimal control is given and a first-order necessary condition of optimality from which optimal solutions can be obtained is established. We develop numerical methods to solve the necessary condition of optimality and present computational results for control of cavity- and channel-type flows showing the feasibility of the proposed approach.
