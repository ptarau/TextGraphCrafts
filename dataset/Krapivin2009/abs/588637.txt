We study the multiplicative Schwarz method for the h- and the p-version Galerkin boundary element method for a hypersingular and a weakly singular integral equation of the first kind. For both integral equations we prove that the contraction rate of the multiplicative Schwarz operator is strictly less than 1 for the h-version for the two level and the multilevel methods, whereas for the p-version we show that the contraction rate approaches one only logarithmically in p for the 2-level method. Computational results are presented for both the h-version and the p-version which support our theory.
