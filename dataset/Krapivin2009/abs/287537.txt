We formulate and solve a new parameter estimation problem in the presence of data uncertainties. The new method is suitable when a priori bounds on the uncertain data are available, and its solution leads to more meaningful results, especially when compared with other methods such as total least-squares and robust estimation. Its superior performance is due to the fact that the new method guarantees that the effect of the uncertainties will never be unnecessarily  over-estimated, beyond what is reasonably assumed by the a priori bounds. A geometric interpretation of the solution is provided, along with a closed form expression for it. We also consider the case in which only selected columns of the coefficient matrix are subject to perturbations.
