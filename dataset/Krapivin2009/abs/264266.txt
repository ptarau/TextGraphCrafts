Recent advances in computer technologies have made it feasible to provide multimedia services, such as news distribution and entertainment, via high-bandwidth networks. The storage and retrieval of large multimedia objects (e.g., video) becomes a major design issue of the multimedia information system. While most other works on multimedia storage servers assume an on-line disk storage system, we consider a two-tier storage architecture with a robotic tape library as the vast near-line storage and an on-line disk system as the front-line storage. Magnetic tapes are cheaper, more robust, and have a larger capacity; hence, they are more cost effective for large scale storage systems (e.g., videoon-demand (VOD) systems may store tens of thousands of videos). We study in detail the design issues of the tape sub-system and propose some novel tape-scheduling algorithms which give faster response and require less disk buffer space. We also study the disk-striping policy and the data layout on the tape cartridge in order to fully utilize the throughput of the robotic tape system and to minimize the on-line disk storage space.
