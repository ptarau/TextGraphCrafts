A csdawg for circular strings, which is obtained by making simple modifications to the compact symmetric directed acyclic word graph (csdawg) for linear strings, is proposed. This data structure does not contain extraneous vertices and, consequently, avoids the disadvantages of previous methods. Using this method, algorithms which make use of the csdawg for linear strings can then be extended to circular strings with trivial modifications. The extended algorithms continue to have the same time and space complexities. Moreover, the extensions take the form of postprocessing or preprocessing steps which are simple to add on to a system built for linear strings, particularly in an object-oriented language.
