Real-world natural language sentences are often long and complex, and contain unexpected grammatical constructions. They even include noise and ungrammaticality. This paper describes the Controlled Skip Parser, a program that parses such real-world sentences by skipping some of the words in the sentence. The new feature of this parser is that it controls its behavior by finding out which words to skip, without using domain-specific knowledge. The parser is a priority-based chart parser. By assigning appropriate priority levels to the constituents in the chart, the parsers behavior is controlled. Statistical information is used for assigning priority levels. The statistical information (n-grams) can be thought of as a generalized approximation of the grammar learned from past successful experiences. The control mechanism gives a great speed-up and reduction in memory usage. Experiments on real newspaper articles are shown, and our experience with this parser in a machine translation system is described.
