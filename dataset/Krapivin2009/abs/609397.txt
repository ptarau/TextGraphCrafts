This paper presents a channel sharing scheme, Neighbor Cell Channel Sharing (NCCS) , based on region partitioning of cell coverage for wireless cellular networks. Each cell is divided into an inner-cell region and an outer-cell region. Cochannel interference is suppressed by limiting the usage of sharing channels in the inner-cell region. The channel sharing scheme achieves a traffic-adaptive channel assignment and does not require any channel locking. Performance analysis shows that using the NCCS scheme leads to a lower call blocking probability and a better channel utilization as compared with other previously proposed channel assignment schemes.
