We propose the use of interactive, user-in-the-loop techniques for controlling physically-based animated characters. With a suitably designed interface, the continuous and discrete input actions afforded by a standard mouse and keyboard allow for the creation of a broad range of motions. We apply our techniques to interactively control planar dynamic simulations of a bounding cat, a gymnastic desk lamp, and a human character capable of walking, running, climbing, and various gymnastic behaviors. The interactive control techniques allows a performer's intuition and knowledge about motion planning to be readily exploited. Video games are the current target application of this work.
