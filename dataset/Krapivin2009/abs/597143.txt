Advances in multimedia computing technologies offer new approaches to the support of computer-assisted education and training within many application domains. Novel interactive presentation tools can be built to enhance traditional teaching methods with more active learning. Since a variety of user expectations are possible in such an environment, research must address the incorporation of these factors into presentation tools. During an interactive learning/training process, presentation tools must be able to handle various types of delays. A flexibly adjustable quality of service (QoS) should thus be supported. In this paper, we investigate a framework and systematic strategies for supporting the continuous and synchronized retrieval and presentation of multimedia data streams in a client/server distributed multimedia environment for educational digital libraries. Specifically, we establish a practical framework for specifying multimedia objects, tasks, schedules, and synchronization constraints between media streams. We identify the QoS parameters critical to the support of multimedia presentations for learning and training activities. Based on the proposed framework and QoS specifications, we develop presentation scheduling and buffer management strategies which can enforce the specified QoS requirements in an educational digital library environment.
