In analogy with the symmetric group, we define the vexillary elements in the hyperoctahedral group to be those for which the Stanley function is a single Schur Q-function. We show that the vexillary elements can be again determined by pattern avoidance conditions. These results can be extended to include the root systems of types A, B, C, and D. Finally, we give an algorithm for multiplication of Schur Q -functions with a superfied Schur function and a method for determining the shape of a vexillary signed permutation using de taquin.
