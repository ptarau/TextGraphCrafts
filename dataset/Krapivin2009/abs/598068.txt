We focus on window flow control as used in packet-switched  communication networks. The approach consists in studying the stability of a  system where each node on the path followed by the packets of the controlled  connection is modeled by a FIFO  queue of infinite capacity which receives in addition some cross traffic  represented by an exogenous flow. Under general stochastic assumptions, namely  for stationary and ergodic input processes, we show the existence of a maximum  throughput allowed by the flow control. Then we establish bounds on the value  of this maximum throughput. These bounds, which do not coincide in general, are  reached by time-space scalings of the exogenous flows. Therefore, the  performance of the window flow control depends not only on the traffic  intensity of the cross flows, but also on fine statistical characteristics such  as the burstiness of these flows. These results are illustrated by several  examples, including the case of a nonmonotone, nonconvex and fractal stability  region.
