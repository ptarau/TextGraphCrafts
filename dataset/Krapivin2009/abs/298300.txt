AbstractThis paper studies the computation of projective invariants in pairs of images from uncalibrated cameras and presents a detailed study of the projective and permutation invariants for configurations of points and/or lines. Two basic computational approaches are given, one algebraic and one geometric. In each case, invariants are computed in projective space or directly from image measurements. Finally, we develop combinations of those projective invariants which are insensitive to permutations of the geometric primitives of each of the basic configurations.
