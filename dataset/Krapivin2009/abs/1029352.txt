We show that the class of monotone 2<sup>O(log<i>n</i>)</sup>-term DNF formulae can be PAC learned in polynomial time under the uniform distribution from random examples only. This is an exponential improvement over the best previous polynomial-time algorithms in this model, which could learn monotone o(log<sup>2</sup> <i>n</i>)-term DNF. We also show that various classes of small constant-depth circuits which compute monotone functions are PAC learnable in polynomial time under the uniform distribution. All of our results extend to learning under any constant-bounded product distribution.
