Using the homotopy invariance property of the  degree and a newly introduced concept of the interior-point-$\varepsilon$-exceptional family for continuous functions, we prove an alternative theorem concerning the existence of a certain interior-point of a continuous  complementarity problem. Based on this result, we develop several sufficient conditions to assure some desirable properties (nonemptyness, boundedness, and upper-semicontinuity) of a multivalued mapping associated with   continuous (nonmonotone) complementarity problems corresponding to  semimonotone, P$(\tau, \alpha, \beta)$-, quasi-P*-, and exceptionally regular maps. The results proved in this paper generalize well-known results on the existence of central paths in continuous P0 complementarity problems.
