Many problems in mathematics, logic, computer science, and engineering can be reduced to the problem of testing positiveness of polynomials (over real numbers). Although the problem is decidable (shown by Tarski in 1930), the general decision methods are not always practically applicable because of their high computational time requirements. Thus several partial methods were proposed in the field of term rewriting systems. In this paper, we exactly determine how partial these methods are, and we propose simpler and/or more efficient methods with the same power.
