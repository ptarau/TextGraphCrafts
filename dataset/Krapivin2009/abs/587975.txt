We examine various problems concerning the reservation of capacity in a given network, where each arc has a per-unit cost, so as to be "resilient" against one or more arc failures.  For a given pair (s,t) of nodes and demand T, we require that, on the failure of any k arcs of the network, there is sufficient reserved capacity in the remainder of the network to support an (s,t) flow of value T.  This problem can be solved in polynomial time for any fixed k, but we show that it is NP-hard if we are required to reserve an integer capacity on each arc.  We concentrate on the case where the reservation has to consist of a collection of arc-disjoint paths: here we give a very simple algorithm to find a minimum cost fractional solution, based on finding successive shortest paths in the network.  Unlike traditional network flow problems, the integral version is NP-hard: we do, however, give a polynomial time $\frac{15}{14}$-approximation algorithm in the case k=1 and show that this bound is best possible unless
