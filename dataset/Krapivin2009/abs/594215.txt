This paper solves an open problem posed by a number of researchers: the construction of a complete calculus for matrix-based methods with rigid E-unification. The use of rigid E-unification and simultaneous rigid E-unification for such methods was proposed by Gallier et al., in 1987. After our proof of the undecidability of simultaneous rigid E-unification in 1995. (Degtyarev and Voronkov, 1996d), it became clear that one should look for more refined techniques to deal with equality in matrix-based methods. In this article, we define a complete proof procedure for first-order logic with equality based on an incomplete but terminating procedure for rigid E-unification. Our approach is applicable to the connection method and the tableau method and is illustrated on the tableau method.
