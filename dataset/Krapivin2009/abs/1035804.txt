This paper presents a protocol for leader election in complete networks with a sense of direction. Sense of direction provides nodes the capability of distinguishing between their incident links according to a global scheme. We propose a protocol for leader election which requires <i>O(N)</i> messages and <i>O</i>(log <i>N</i>) time. The protocol is message optimal and the time complexity is a significant improvement over currently known protocols for this problem.
