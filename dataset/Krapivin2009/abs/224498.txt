Abstract: DSP algorithms are, in most cases, subject to hard real-time constraints. In the case of programmable DSPs, meeting those constraints must be ensured by appropriate code generation techniques. For processors offering instruction-level parallelism, the task of code generation includes code compaction. The exact timing behavior of a DSP program is only known after compaction. Therefore, real-time constraints should be taken into account during the compaction phase. While most known DSP code generators rely on rigid heuristics for that phase, this paper proposes a novel approach to local code compaction based on an integer programming model, which obeys exact timing constraints. Due to a general problem formulation, the model also obeys encoding restrictions and possible side-effects.
