The growing size of 3D digital images causes sequential algorithms to be less and less usable on whole images and a parallelization of these algorithm is often required. We have developed an algorithm named Sewing Faces which synthesizes both geometrical and topological information on bounding surface of 6-connected3D objects. We call such combined information a skin. In this paper we present a parallelization of Sewing Faces. It is based on a splitting of 3D images into several sub-blocks. When all the sub-blocks are processed a gluing step consists of merging all the sub-skins to get the final skin. Moreover we propose a fine-grain approach where each sub-block is processed by several parallel processors.
