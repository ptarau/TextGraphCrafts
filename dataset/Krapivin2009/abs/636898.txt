An analytical framework for modeling a network of random early detection (RED) queues with mixed traffic types (e.g. TCP and UDP) is developed. Expressions for the steady-state goodput for each flow and the average queuing delay at each queue are derived. The framework is extended to include a class of RED queues that provides differentiated services for flows with multiple classes. Finally, the analysis is validated against ns simulations for a variety of RED network configurations where it is shown that the analytical results match with those of the simulations within a mean error of 5%. Several new analytical results are obtained; TCP throughput formula for a RED queue; TCP timeout formula for a RED queue and the fairness index for RED and tail drop.
