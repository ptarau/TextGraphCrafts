We show that the feasibility of a system of m linear inequalities over the cone of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices of order n can be tested in mn^O(min{m,n^2}) arithmetic operations with ln^O(min{m,n^2})-bit numbers, where l is the maximum binary size of the input coefficients. We also show that any feasible system of dimension (m,n) has a solution X such that log||X|| ln^O(min{m,n^2}).
