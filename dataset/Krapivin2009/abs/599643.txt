We consider on-line density estimation with a parameterized density from the exponential family. The on-line algorithm receives one example at a time and maintains a parameter that is essentially an average of the past examples. After receiving an example the algorithm incurs a loss, which is the negative log-likelihood of the example with respect to the current parameter of the algorithm. An off-line algorithm can choose the best parameter based on all the examples. We prove bounds on the additional total loss of the on-line algorithm over the total loss of the best off-line parameter. These relative loss bounds hold for an arbitrary sequence of examples. The goal is to design algorithms with the best possible relative loss bounds. We use a Bregman divergence to derive and analyze each algorithm. These divergences are relative entropies between two exponential distributions. We also use our methods to prove relative loss bounds for linear regression.
