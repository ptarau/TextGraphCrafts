A common task in automated manufacturing processes is to orient parts prior to assembly. We consider sensorless orientation of an asymmetric polyhedral part by a sequence of push actions, and show that is it possible to move any such part from an unknown initial orientation into a known final orientation if these actions are performed by a jaw consisting of two orthogonal planes. We also show how to compute an orienting sequence of push actions.We propose a three-dimensional generalization of conveyor belts with fences consisting of a sequence of tilted plates with curved tips; each of the plates contains a sequence of fences. We show that it is possible to compute a set-up of plates and fences for any given asymmetric polyhedral part such that the part gets oriented on its descent along plates and fences.
