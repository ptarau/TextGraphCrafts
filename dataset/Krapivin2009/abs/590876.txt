This paper presents a neural network system for the diagnosis of analog circuits and shows how the performance of such a system can be affected by the choice of different techniques used by its submodules. In particular we discuss the influence of feature extraction techniques such as Fourier Transforms, Wavelets and Principal Component Analysis. The system uses several different power supplies and as many neural networks in parallel. Two different algorithms that can be used to combine the candidate sets produced by each network are also presented. The system is capable of diagnosing multiple faults even if trained on single ones.
