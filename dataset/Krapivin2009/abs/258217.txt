LAPACK and LINPACK both solve symmetric indefinite linear systems using the diagonal pivoting method with the partial pivoting strategy of Bunch and Kaufman [Math. Comp., 31 (1977), pp. 163--179]. No proof of the stability of this method has appeared in the literature. It is tempting to argue that the diagonal pivoting method is stable for a given pivoting strategy if the growth factor is small. We show that this argument is false in general and give a sufficient condition for stability. This condition is not satisfied by the partial pivoting strategy because the multipliers are unbounded. Nevertheless, using a more specific approach we are able to prove the stability of partial pivoting, thereby filling a gap in the body of theory supporting LAPACK and LINPACK.
