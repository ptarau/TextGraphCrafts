AbstractStreak lines and particle traces are effective visualization techniques for studying unsteady fluid flows. For real-time applications, accuracy is often sacrificed to achieve interactive frame rates. Physical space particle tracing algorithms produce the most accurate results although they are usually too expensive for interactive applications. An efficient physical space algorithm is presented in this paper which was developed for interactive investigation and visualization of large, unsteady, aeronautical simulations. Performance has been increased by applying tetrahedral decomposition to speed up point location and velocity interpolation in curvilinear grids. Preliminary results from batch computations [1] showed that this approach was up to six times faster than the most common algorithm which uses the Newton-Raphson method and trilinear interpolation. Results presented here show that the tetrahedral approach also permits interactive computation and visualization of unsteady particle traces. Statistics are given for frame rates and computation times on single and multiprocessors. The benefits of interactive feature detection in unsteady flows are also demonstrated.
