This paper summarizes the research on population-based probabilistic search algorithms based on modeling promising solutions by estimating their probability distribution and using the constructed model to guide the exploration of the search space. It settles the algorithms in the field of genetic and evolutionary computation where they have been originated, and classifies them into a few classes according to the complexity of models they use. Algorithms within each class are briefly described and their strengths and weaknesses are discussed.
