A suite of computer programs for the evaluation of Bessel functions and modified Bessel functions of orders zero and one for a vector of real arguments is described. Distinguishing characteristics of these programs are that (a) they are portable across a wide range of machines, and (b) they are vectorized in the case when multiple function evaluations are to be performed. The performance of the new programs are compared with software from the FNLIB collection of Fullerton on which the new software is based.
