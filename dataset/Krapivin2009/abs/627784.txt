AbstractThe well-founded semantics and the stable model semantics capture intuitions of the skeptical and credulous semantics in nonmonotonic reasoning, respectively. They represent the two dominant proposals for the declarative semantics of deductive databases and logic programs. However, neither semantics seems to be suitable for all applications. We have developed an efficient implementation of goal-oriented effective query evaluation under the well-founded semantics. It produces a residual program for subgoals that are relevant to a query, which contains facts for true instances and clauses with body literals for undefined instances. This paper presents a simple method of stable model computation that can be applied to the residual program of a query to derive answers with respect to stable models. The method incorporates both forward and backward chaining to propagate the assumed truth values of ground atoms, and derives multiple stable models through backtracking. Users are able to request that only stable models satisfying certain conditions be computed. A prototype has been developed that provides integrated query evaluation under the well-founded semantics, the stable models, and ordinary Prolog execution. We describe the user interface of the prototype and present some experimental results.
