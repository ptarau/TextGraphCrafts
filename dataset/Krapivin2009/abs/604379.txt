Decoupling techniques can be applied to a vector processor, resulting in a large increase in performance of vectorizable programs. We simulate a selection of the Perfect Club and Specfp92 benchmark suites and compare their execution time on a conventional single port vector architecture with that of a decoupled vector architecture. Decoupling increases the performance by a factor greater than 1.4 for realistic memory latencies, and for an ideal memory system with zero latency, there is still a speedup of as much as 1.3. A significant portion of this paper is devoted to studying the tradeoffs involved in choosing a suitable size for the queues of the decoupled architecture. The hardware cost of the queues need not be large to achieve most of the performance advantages of decoupling.
