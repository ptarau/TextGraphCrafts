We describe an algebraic technique for performing timing analysis of a class of asynchronous circuits described as CSP programs (including Martins probe operator) with the restrictions that there is no OR-causality and that guard selection is either completely free or mutually exclusive. Such a description is transformed into a safe Petri net with interval time delays specified on the places of the net. The timing analysis we perform determines the extreme separation in time between two communication actions of the CSP program for all possible timed executions of the system. We formally define this problem, propose an algorithm for its solution, and demonstrate polynomial running time on a non-trivial parameterized example. Petri nets with 3000 nodes and 10^16 reachable states have been analyzed using these techniques.
