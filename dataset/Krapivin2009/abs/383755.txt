Fueled by the large number of powerful light-weight portable computers, the expanding availability of wireless networks, and the popularity of the Internet, there is an increasing demand to connect portable computers to the Internet at any time and in any place. However, the dynamic nature of a mobile host's connectivity and its use of multiple network interfaces require more flexible network support than has typically been available for stationary workstations. This paper introduces two flow-oriented mechanisms, in the context of Mobile IP [25], to ensure a mobile host's robust and efficient communication with other hosts in a changing environment. One mechanism supports multiple packet delivery methods (such as regular IP or Mobile IP) and adaptively selects the most  appropriate one to use according to the characteristics of each traffic flow. The other mechanism enables a mobile host to make use of multiple network interfaces simultaneously and to control the selection of the most desirable network interfaces for both outgoing and incoming packets for different traffic flows. We demonstrate the usefulness of these two network layer mechanisms and describe their implementation and performance.
