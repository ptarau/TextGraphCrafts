The finite mass method, a new Lagrangian method for the numerical simulation of gas flows, is presented and analyzed. In contrast to the finite volume and the finite element method, the finite mass method is founded on a discretization of mass, not of space. Mass is subdivided into small mass packets of finite extension, each of which is equipped with finitely many internal degrees of freedom. These mass packets move under the influence of internal and external forces and the laws of thermodynamics and can undergo arbitrary linear deformations. The method is based on an approach recently developed by Yserentant and can attain a very high accuracy.
