Self-stabilizing message-driven protocols are defined and discussed.      The class weak exclusion that contains many natural tasks      such as $\ell$-exclusion and token passing is defined,      and it is shown that in any execution of any self-stabilizing      protocol for a task in this class, the configuration size must grow      at least in a logarithmic rate. This last lower bound is valid even      if the system is supported by a time-out mechanism that prevents      communication deadlocks. Then we present three self-stabilizing      message-driven protocols for token passing. The rate of growth of      configuration size for all three protocols matches the aforementioned      lower bound. Our protocols are presented for two-processor systems      but can be easily adapted to rings of arbitrary size. Our results      have an interesting interpretation in terms of automata theory.
