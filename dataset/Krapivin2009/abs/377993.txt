Automata on infinite words are used for specification and verification of nonterminating programs. Different types of automata induce different levels of expressive power, of succinctness, and of complexity. Alternating automata have both existential and universal branching modes and are particularly suitable for specification of programs. In a weak alternating automata the state space is partitioned into partially ordered sets, and the automaton can proceed from a certain set only to smaller sets. Reasoning about weak alternating automata is easier than reasoning about alternating automata with no restricted structure. Known translations of alternating automata to weak alternating automata involve determinization, and therefore involve a double-exponential blow-up. In this paper we describe a quadratic translation, which circumvents the need for determinization, of Bchi and co-Bchi alternating automata to weak alternating automata. Beyond the independent interest of such a translation, it gives rise to a simple complementation algorithm for nondeterministic Bchi automata.
