One of the primary advantages of a high-level synthesis system is its ability to explore the design space. This paper presents several methodologies for design space exploration that compute all optimal tradeoff points for the combined problem of scheduling, clock-length determination, and module selection. We discuss how each methodology takes advantage of the structure within the design space itself as well as the structure of, and interactions among, each of the three subproblems. (CAD)
