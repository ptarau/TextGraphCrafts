This paper introduces a  valuation model of international pricing in  the presence of political risk. Shipments between countries are  charged with shipping costs and the country specific production  processes are modelled as diffusion processes. The political risk is  modelled as a continous time jump process that affects the drift of the  returns in the politically unstable countries. The valuation model  gives rise to a singular stochastic control problem that is  analyzed numerically. The fundamental tools come from the theory of  viscosity solutions of the associated HamiltonJacobiBellman equation  which turns out to be a system of integral-differential  Variational  Inequalities with gradient constraints.
