While deterministic finite automata seem to be well understood, surprisingly many important problems concerning nondeterministic finite automata (nfa's) remain open. One such problem area is the study of different measures of nondeterminism in finite automata and the estimation of the sizes of minimal nondeterministic finite automata. In this paper the concept of communication complexity is applied in order to achieve progress in this problem area. The main results are as follows:(1) Deterministic communication complexity provides lower bounds on the size of nfa's with bounded unambiguity. Applying this fact, the proofs of several results about nfa's with limited ambiguity can be simplified and presented in a uniform way. (2) There is a family of languages KONk2 with an exponential size gap between nfa's with polynomial leaf number/ambiguity and nfa's with ambiguity k. This partially provides an answer to the open problem posed by B. Ravikumar and O. Ibarra (1989, SIAM J. Comput. 18, 1263-1282) and H. Leung (1998, SIAM J. Comput. 27, 1073-1082).
