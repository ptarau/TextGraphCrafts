Several relationships between software testing criteria, each induced by a relation between the corresponding multisets of subdomains, are examined. The authors discuss whether for each relation R and each pair of criteria, C/sub 1/ and C/sub 2/, R(C/sub 1/, C/sub 2/) guarantees that C/sub 1/ is better at detecting faults than C/sub 2/ according to various probabilistic measures of fault-detecting ability. It is shown that the fact that C/sub 1/ subsumes C/sub 2/ does not guarantee that C/sub 1/ is better at detecting faults. Relations that strengthen the subsumption relation and that have more bearing on fault-detecting ability are introduced.
