Real-time collaborative editing systems are groupware systems that allow multiple users to edit the same document at the same time from multiple sites. A specific type of collaborative editing system is the object-based collaborative graphics editing system. One of the major challenge in building such systems is to solve the concurrency control problems. This paper addresses the concurrency control problem of how to preserve the intentions of concurrently generated operations whose effects are conflicting. An object replication strategy is proposed to preserve the intentions of all operations. The effects of conflicting operations are applied to different replicas of the same object, while non-conflicting operations are applied to the same object. An object identification scheme is proposed to uniquely and consistently identify non-replicated and replicated objects. Lastly, an object replication algorithm is proposed to produce consistent replication effects at all sites.
