AbstractThe bound on component failures and their spatial distribution govern the fault tolerance of any candidate error-detecting algorithm. For distributed memory multiprocessors, the specific algorithm and the topology of the processor interconnection network define these bounds. This paper introduces the maximal fault index, derived from the system topology and local communication patterns, to demonstrate how a maximal number of simultaneous component failures can be tolerated for a particular interconnection network and error-detecting algorithm. The index is used to design a mapping of processes to processor groups such that the error-detecting ability of the algorithm is preserved for certain multiple simultaneous processor failures.
