The paper develops the mathematics of the heavy traffic approach to  the control and optimal control problem for multiplexing systems, where there  are many mutually independent sources which feed into a single channel via a  multiplexer (or of networks composed of such subsystems). Due to the  widely varying bit rates over all sources, control over admission, bandwidth,  etc., is needed to assure good performance. Optimal control and heavy traffic  analysis has been shown to yield systems with greatly improved performance.  Indeed, the heavy traffic approach covers many cases of great current interest,  and provides a useful and practical approach to problems of analysis and  control arising in modern high speed telecommunications. Past works on the  heavy traffic approach to the multiplexing problem concentrated on the  uncontrolled system or on the use of the heavy traffic limit control problem  for applications, and did not provide details of the proofs. This is done in  the current paper. The basic control problem for the physical system is hard,  and the heavy traffic approach provides much simplification. Owing to the  presence of the control, as well as to the fact that the cost function of main  interest is ergodic, the problem cannot be fully treated with  classical methods of heavy traffic analysis for queueing  networks. A basic result is that the optimal average costs per unit time for  the physical problem converge to the optimal cost per unit time for the limit  stationary process as the number of sources and the time interval goes to  infinity. This convergence is both in the mean and pathwise senses.  Furthermore, a nice nearly optimal control for the limit system  provides nearly optimal values for the physical system, under heavy traffic, in  both a mean and pathwise sense.
