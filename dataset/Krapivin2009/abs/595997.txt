The main factor of intelligence is defined as the ability to  comprehend, formalising this ability with the help of new constructs  based on descriptional complexity. The result is a comprehension test,  or C-test, which is exclusively defined in computational terms. Due to  its absolute and non-anthropomorphic character, it is equally applicable  to both humans and non-humans. Moreover, it correlates with classical  psychometric tests, thus establishing the first firm connection between  information theoretical notions and traditional IQ tests. The Turing  Test is compared with the C-test and the combination of the two is  questioned. In consequence, the idea of using the Turing Test as a  practical test of intelligence should be surpassed, and substituted by  computational and factorial tests of different cognitive abilities, a  much more useful approach for artificial intelligence progress and for  many other intriguing questions that present themselves beyond the  Turing Test.
