In the context of the abstract interpretation theory, we study the relations among various abstract domains for groundness analysis of the logic programs. We reconstruct the well-known domain as a logical domain in a fully automatic way and we prove that it is the best abstract domain which can be set up from the property of groundness by applying logic operators only. We propose a new notion of optimality which precisely captures the relation between and its natural concrete domain. This notion enables us to discriminate between the various abstract domains for groundness analysis from a computational point of view and to compare their relative precision. Finally, we propose a new domain for groundness analysis which has the advantage of being independent from the specific program and we show it optimality. Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
