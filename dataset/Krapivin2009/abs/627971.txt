AbstractStorage and retrieval of multimedia has become a requirement for many contemporary information systems. These systems need to provide browsing, querying, navigation, and, sometimes, composition capabilities involving various forms of media. In this survey, we review techniques and systems for image and video retrieval. We first look at visual features for image retrieval such as color, texture, shape, and spatial relationships. The indexing techniques are discussed for these features. Nonvisual features include captions, annotations, relational attributes, and structural descriptions. Temporal aspects of video retrieval and video segmentation are discussed next. We review several systems for image and video retrieval including research, commercial, and World Wide Web-based systems. We conclude with an overview of current challenges and future trends for image and video retrieval.
