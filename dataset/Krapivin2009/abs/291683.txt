This paper is concerned with properties of the Mullineux map, which plays a rle in p-modular representation theory of symmetric groups. We introduce the residue symbol for a p-regular partitions, a variation of the Mullineux symbol, which makes the detection and removal of good nodes (as introduced by Kleshchev) in the partition easy to describe. Applications of this idea include a short proof of the combinatorial conjecture to which the Mullineux conjecture had been reduced by Kleshchev.
