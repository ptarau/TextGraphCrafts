The ordered semantic hyper-linking strategy is complete for first-order logic and accepts a user-specified natural semantics that guides the search for a proof. Any semantics in which the meanings of the function and predicate symbols are computable on ground terms may be used. This instance-based strategy is efficient on near-propositional problems, is goal sensitive, and has an extension to equality and term rewriting. However, it sometimes has difficulty generating large terms. We compare this strategy with some others that use semantic information, and present a proof of soundness and completeness. We also give some theoretical results about the search efficiency of the strategy. Some examples illustrate the performance of the strategy.
