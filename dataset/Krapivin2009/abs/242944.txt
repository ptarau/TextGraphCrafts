An approximate minimum degree (AMD) ordering algorithm  for preordering a  symmetric sparse matrix  prior to numerical factorization is presented.  We use techniques  based on the quotient graph for matrix factorization that allow us to  obtain computationally cheap bounds for the minimum degree. We show that  these bounds are often equal to the actual degree.  The resulting  algorithm is typically much faster than previous minimum degree ordering  algorithms and produces results that are comparable in quality with the  best orderings from other minimum degree algorithms.
