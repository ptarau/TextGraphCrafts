The sequential minimal optimization algorithm (SMO) has been shown to be an effective method for training support vector machines (SVMs) on classification tasks defined on sparse data sets. SMO differs from most SVM algorithms in that it does not require a quadratic programming solver. In this work, we generalize SMO so that it can handle regression problems. However, one problem with SMO is that its rate of convergence slows down dramatically when data is non-sparse and when there are many support vectors in the solutionas is often the case in regressionbecause kernel function evaluations tend to dominate the runtime in this case. Moreover, caching kernel function outputs can easily degrade SMO's performance even more because SMO tends to access kernel function outputs in an unstructured manner. We address these problems with several modifications that enable caching to be effectively used with SMO. For regression problems, our modifications improve convergence time by over an order of magnitude.
