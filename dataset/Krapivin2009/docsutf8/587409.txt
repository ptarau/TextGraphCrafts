Asymptotic Analysis of the Laminar Viscous Flow Over a Porous Bed.
--A
We consider the laminar viscous channel flow over a porous  surface.  The size of the pores is much smaller than the size of  the channel, and it is important to determine the effective  boundary conditions at the porous surface.  We study the  corresponding boundary layers, and,  by a rigorous asymptotic  expansion, we obtain Saffman's modification of the interface condition  observed by Beavers and Joseph. The effective coefficient in the  law is determined through an auxiliary boundary-layer type  problem, whose computational and modeling aspects are discussed in  detail. Furthermore, the approximation errors for the velocity and  for the effective mass flow are given as powers of the  characteristic pore size $\ep$. Finally, we give the interface condition  linking the effective pressure fields in the porous medium and in  the channel, and we determine the jump of the effective pressures  explicitly.

Introduction
Finding eective boundary conditions at the surface which separates a channel
ow and a porous medium is a classical problem.
Supposing a laminar incompressible and viscous
ow, we nd out immediately
that the eective
ow in a porous solid is described by Darcy's law. In the free
uid we obviously keep the Navier-Stokes system. Hence we have two completely
dierent systems of partial dierential equations. First, Darcy's law combined
with the incompressibility gives a second order equation for the pressure and a
rst order system for the velocity. In the Navier-Stokes system, the orders of the
corresponding dierential operators are dierent, and it is not clear what kind
of conditions one should impose at the interface between the free
uid and the
porous part. Clearly, due to the incompressibility, the normal mass
ux should
be continuous. Other classically used conditions are the continuity of the pressure
and, for a free
uid, the vanishing of the tangential velocity at the interface.
Let us discuss the mathematical background of the interface conditions. It
is well-known that Darcy's law is a statistical result giving the average of the
momentum equation (the Navier-Stokes equations) over the pore structure. Its
rigorous derivation involves the weak convergence in
div) (respectively the
two-scale convergence) of velocities, and only the continuity of the normal velocities
is preserved. Other continuity conditions at the interface are generally lost, such
that further analysis is required.
Concerning other interface conditions used in engineering literature, the vanishing
of the tangential velocity is found to be an unsatisfactory approximation,
and in [2] a new condition is proposed. The condition reads
where ~u e is the eective velocity in the channel, ~v f is the mean ltration velocity
given by Darcy's law, ~ is a tangent vector to the interface, ~ is the normal into the

uid, K is the permeability of the porous medium, and the scalar  is a function
of the geometry of the porous medium.
In [2], this law is derived by heuristic arguments and justied experimentally.
A theoretical attempt to derive (1.1) is undertaken in [15] and, using a statistical
approach, a Brinkman type approximation in the transition layer is derived. A
matching argument then allows to obtain the formula
The interested reader can also consult the lecture note [4].
Dierent considerations can be found in [5] and [11]. They distinguish two
cases:
(a) The pressure gradient on the side of the porous solid of the interface is normal
to the interface. Consequently, we have a balanced
ow on both sides of the
interface. Then, using an asymptotic point of view, the following laws are
obtained in [11]: ( ~u e
on the interface. This case describes the
ows in cavities. The mathematical
justication is in [9]. We shall not consider it in this paper.
(b) The pressure gradient on the side of the porous solid at the interface is
not normal. This case is considered in the fundamental paper [5]. After
discussing the orders of magnitude of the unknowns it is found out that
on the interface the velocity of the free
uid is zero, and the pressure is
continuous.
All results cited above are not mathematically rigorous. Furthermore, dierent
approaches give dierent results and two natural questions arise immediately:
(Q1) What are the correct matching conditions (i.e. conditions at the interface)
between those two
ow equations?
(Q2) What are the eective constants entering the matching conditions?
We are going to answer those questions in the following. In Section 2, we
dene our problem and discuss some simple approximations. In Section 3, we
introduce an important auxiliary problem of boundary layer type which we need
to construct a better approximation, and Section 4 gives additional results for an
analogous problem on a nite strip. Then, in Section 7, the eective equations
with the Beavers-Joseph type boundary condition are presented together with
improved error estimates. Finally, in Section 6, we show how the computation of
the constants involved in the interface conditions works in practice. Especially, it
turns out that the dierence between Darcy's pressure in the porous part and the
eective channel pressure is equal to a constant multiple of the eective channel
shear stress, thus contradicting [11].

This section deals with the equations describing

under a uniform pressure gradient. We assume the condition of the experiment by
Beavers and Joseph [2], i.e. a stationary laminar incompressible viscous

Proof. (3.12) follows immediately from (3.6) by

Z 1@ bl@y 1
Then, by integrating the second component of the momentum equation (3.5) over
the rectangle (0; 1)  (a; b) we obtain
and (3.13) follows by applying (3.12).
Next, integrate the rst component of the momentum equation (3.5) over (0; 1)
with respect to y 1 . Using (3.13) we nd out that
linear
function of y 2 . Since it is bounded in the limit y it has to be a constant
for y 2  0, which proves (3.14).
Finally, after taking
bl as the test function in (3.11), we obtain (3.15).
We expect that the problem (3.5){(3.10) represents a boundary layer. This
means that changes of the velocity and the pressure elds are concentrated around
the interface S and vanish very rapidly with increasing distance from S. In linear
elasticity, results of this type are called Saint-Venant's principle. Saint-Venant's
principle is also valid in our case, and we want to discuss this in more detail.
We start our considerations with Z (the part of Z bl lled by the
uid). Here,
one can obtain sharp decay estimates by using results for the decay of solutions of
general elliptic equations (see Theorem 10.1 from [12], which is an application of
Tartar's lemma). However, in our particular situation we can give a direct proof:

Furthermore, by (3.14) and periodicity, we conclude that
Consequently, the solution  bl of (3.19) may be written as
We see, that the leading decay exponent is proportional to 2, such that (3.17)
and (3.18) follow.
With the help of this estimate for

from which the assertion follows.
Now we turn our attention to the porous part Z . Due to the presence of the
solid obstacles, our estimates will be much less precise in this case.

on a nite domain
In this section we propose a scheme for computing the actual values of C bl

cases where the geometry of the porous medium is known. Since problem
resp. (3.11) is dened on an innite domain Z bl , the rst step is
to approximate its solution with solutions of problems dened on nite domains

the following properties for the solution ( ~  bl

5 Discretization
Now, we turn our attention to the discretization of problem (4.1){(4.8). Essen-
tially, we use a stabilized nite element discretization in the sense of [8],[3]. Unfor-
tunately, in both of these papers only polygonal domains were considered, so that
the direct application of these results to our domain Z k
l is unsatisfying because
of the curved boundaries
l
We resolve this diculty by using
generalized domain partitions given by nonlinear mappings of the elements while
essentially keeping the approximation results known for usual domain partitions
with linear mappings, see [19], [20], [1], [14]. While this is very convenient theoret-
ically, the practical implementation will usually be too complicated. Therefore, it
is important that the use of a simpler polygonal approximation of the domain can
be interpreted as a perturbation of this approach, see the discussion at the end of
this section.

Arbitrary ne triangulations of this kind exist, which can be shown by modifying
triangulations of polygonal approximations of the
domain
see [19]. The quality
of the domain partition T h is determined by the constants C

properties (especially property 5).
Next, let
where P 1 is the space of linear polynomials, and Q 1 is the span of P 1 and the
polynomial x 1 x 2 . With these nite elements, we can dene the space
The following approximation result is then the substitute for approximation
results on triangulations with linear element mappings.
Theorem 17
Let
h be as above. Then, for

exists such that
Second, for
, an u h 2 S h exists such that


Additionally, if u has zero boundary values on some component of
@
, then also u h
can be chosen such that it has zero boundary values on that boundary component.
In all cases, the constants only depend on the smoothness of the domain and
the quality of the domain partition T h .
Proof. See [19], [20] for the case of (deformed) triangular elements, and [14]
where also the case of (deformed) quadrilaterals is handled by using a generalized
interpolation operator of Clement type.
Remark In contrast to standard interpolation results for triangulations with
linear element mappings, the term kruk L
appears on the right hand side of (5.6).
This is due to the fact that linear functions are no more interpolated exactly (in
contrast to constant functions). Note that this estimate is only possible because the
e approximate linear mappings in the limit diam(e) ! 0 (see property 5 required
for a partition T h ).

Proof. The proof can be done as in [8], [3], or [7] with the following modi-
cations: rst, on our more general domain partitions, the approximation results
from theorem 17 replace the standard ones. Second, [8], [3], [7] handle only the
Dirichlet case. However, one can easily check, that their proofs can be transfered
with almost no changes because the slip boundary condition still allows for partial
integration with vanishing boundary terms. For (5.14), the proof uses the
assertion of Lemma 13 such that the factor k needs to be included in the
estimate. For (5.15), one needs the H 2 -regularity estimate from proposition 15
which introduces the factor k + 1.
We now describe the denition of the discrete approximations to C bl

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the practical implementation of
domain partitions with nonlinear element mappings is rather complicated. It is
usually easier to approximate a
domain
with curved boundaries by polygonal
domains
h which then can be partitioned in triangles and/or quadrangles (see
for example [17]). However, it can be shown that, on a discrete level, this simpler
approach is equivalent to our theoretically more convenient formulation up to a
quadrature error of optimal order, see [18].

6 Numerical Results
We are now ready to demonstrate our method for computing the constants C bland C bl
on specic examples. First, we consider the symmetric geometry shown
on the left part of Figure 3. The boundary @Z  is a circle with radius 0:25 and
center at (0:5; 0:5). On the right-hand side of Figure 3, the initial polygonal
approximation and the initial grid T h0 with quadrangle elements (see section 5)
is depicted. T h0 is then uniformly rened, yielding further grids T
. By
using the discretization described in the previous section, we obtain for every
a system of linear equations which must be solved to obtain the
discrete solution f ~
bl
k;l;h g.
Since the arising linear systems are very large, we have applied the multigrid
method which is known to be of optimal complexity for a large range of problems,
see [6]. However, due to the pressure stabilization and the polygonal approximation
of the smooth boundary
l
k=1 (@Z  (0; k)), we are not in a Galerkin setting.
In this case, it is known that the simple multigrid V-cycle (one coarse-grid correction
between pre- and post-smoothing) does not have to converge independently
of the number of levels. We therefore used the W-cycle (two coarse-grid corrections
between smoothing). Both pre- and post-smoothing are done by two steps
of a block incomplete decomposition where each block contains the unknowns of
one grid node (the corners of the elements). And indeed, our numerical observa-

variations of the parameters k; l, see also Table 5 below.
In

from the coarsest level which contains 20 elements, we rene 5 times, which yields

1;k;l;h and
!;k;l;h converge to limit values with rate O(h 2 ) which we expected from Proposition
19. As shown in Remark 9, C bl
must be zero. Since our grid is symmetric,
the solution of the discrete problem also has the same symmetry property, such
that the approximations C bl
!;k;l;h are zero up to machine accuracy.
Let us now assume that the porous part is generated by the unsymmetric cell

the boundary layer.
Finally, Table 5 shows the convergence rates of our multigrid iteration. As
we expected from the discussion above, it is perfectly robust with respect to the
number of levels. So far, we did not observe a signicant dependency on k or
l, even if one might expect some deterioration, since the error estimates from
Proposition 19 are needed in the usual W-cycle convergence theory. The reason
might be that sharper error estimates are possible in suitably weighted norms.

It should be noted that the presence of the logarithmic term is a consequence of
the corner singularities in the eective pressure. It was proved in [9] that in the
absence of the boundary singularities, the above estimates hold without the log "
term. Therefore, in the interior of the
domain
the expansion (7.5) is of order
O(" 3=2 ). Globally, it is of order O(" 3=2 j log "j).
The estimates (7.16)-(7.18) are sucient for calculating the next order correction
at the interface . The estimate (7.18) gives us a possibility of approximating
the velocity values at  by an oscillatory velocity eld. Computationally, it is not
very useful.
In view of the problem setting in [9], the Beavers{Joseph law corresponds to
taking into the account the next order corrections for the velocity. In fact, we
formally get on the interface :

Integrals of the absolute value of the right hand side are not small, since our

The precise estimates are in [10]. Hence, we get the eective law

By using the theory of the very weak solutions for the Stokes system, the

The estimates (7.32)-(7.34) justify Saman's modication of the law by Beavers
and Joseph. Furthermore, we are able to calculate their proportionality
it is equal toC blK 1=2 . We note that (7.28) is not the only possible interface
law. If one replaces Beavers and Joseph's law by u e
(0) the estimates
remain valid. However, such a condition involves the knowledge of
the zeroth order approximation v 0
1 , and is not really an interface condition.
At this stage, we can consider the approximation to the channel
ow as satis-
but we still must determine the ltration velocity and the pressure in the
porous medium. We have already mentioned the in
uence of corner singularities
on the solution of the problem (7.8)-(7.10). In order to avoid the discussion of such
eects, we limit ourselves to the behavior in the interior of the porous medium.
The inertia eects are negligible and we can use the theory from [9], Theorem 3.
In the interior, all boundary layer eects are exponentially small and we have
~
where ~
are dened by (7.12). Hence, the ltration velocity is given
through the Darcy law
in
Far away from the corners, the pressure eld p approximates p " at order O(
").
It can only be determined after we have found the eective pressure eld in the
channel and the stabilization constant C bl
giving the pressure dierence at innities
for the auxiliary problem. As shown in Section 6, this stabilization constant is
generally dierent from zero and we must use the interface law
This shows that, contrary to the intuition, the eective pressure in the system
channel
ow/porous medium is not always continuous. Thus, the continuity assumption
for the eective pressure from [11] is not correct in general.
Finally, let us note that we have some freedom in choosing the position of the
interface. It could be set at any distance of order O(") from the solid obstacles.
Intuitively, the law of Beavers and Joseph should be independent of such a choice.
This invariance result can be established rigorously, and we refer for details to [13]
where it was proved that a perturbation of order O(") in the position of the interface
implies a perturbation in the solution of order O(" 2 ). Consequently, the
eective law doesn't change and the physical intuition is conrmed.
