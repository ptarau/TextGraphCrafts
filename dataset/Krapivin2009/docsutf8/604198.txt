Qualitative probabilistic networks are qualitative abstractions of probabilistic networks, summarising probabilistic influences by qualitative signs. As qualitative networks model influences at the level of variables, knowledge about probabilistic influences that hold only for specific values cannot be expressed. The results computed from a qualitative network, as a consequence, can be weaker than strictly necessary and may in fact be rather uninformative. We extend the basic formalism of qualitative probabilistic networks by providing for the inclusion of context-specific information about influences and show that exploiting this information upon reasoning has the ability to forestall unnecessarily weak results.

Introduction
Qualitative probabilistic networks are qualitative abstractions
of probabilistic networks [Wellman, 1990] , introduced for
probabilistic reasoning in a qualitative way. A qualitative
probabilistic network encodes statistical variables and the
probabilistic relationships between them in a directed acyclic
graph. Each node A in this digraph represents a variable. An
a probabilistic influence of the variable
A on the probability distribution of the variable B; the
influence is summarised by a qualitative sign indicating the
direction of shift in B's distribution. For probabilistic inference
with a qualitative network, an efficient algorithm, based
upon the idea of propagating and combining signs, is available
[Druzdzel & Henrion, 1993 ] .
Qualitative probabilistic networks can play an important
role in the construction of probabilistic networks for real-life
application domains. While constructing the digraph of a
probabilistic network is doable, the assessment of all probabilities
required is a much harder task and is only performed
when the network's digraph is considered robust. By eliciting
signs from domain experts, the obtained qualitative probabilistic
network can be used to study and validate the reasoning
behaviour of the network prior to probability assessment;
the signs can further be used as constraints on the probabilities
to be assessed [Druzdzel & Van der Gaag, 1995 ] . To
be able to thus exploit a qualitative probabilistic network, it
This work was partly funded by the EPSRC under grant
should capture as much qualitative information from the application
domain as possible. In this paper, we propose an
extension to the basic formalism of qualitative networks to
enhance its expressive power for this purpose.
Probabilistic networks provide, by means of their digraph,
for a qualitative representation of the conditional independences
that are embedded in a joint probability distribu-
tion. The digraph in essence captures independences between
nodes, that is, it models independences that hold for all values
of the associated variables. The independences that hold
only for specific values are not represented in the digraph but
are captured instead by the conditional probabilities associated
with the nodes in the network. Knowledge of these latter
independences allows further decomposition of conditional
probabilities and can be exploited to speed up inference. For
this purpose, a notion of context-specific independence was
introduced for probabilistic networks to explicitly capture independences
that hold only for specific values of variables
[Boutilier et al., 1996; Zhang & Poole, 1999 ] .
A qualitative probabilistic network equally captures independences
between variables by means of its digraph. Since
its qualitative influences pertain to variables as well, independences
that hold only for specific values of the variables
involved cannot be represented. In fact, qualitative influences
implicitly hide such context-specific independences: if the
influence of a variable A on a variable B is positive in one
context, that is, for one combination of values for some other
variables, and zero in all other contexts - indicating independence
- then the influence is captured by a positive sign. Also,
positive and negative influences may be hidden: if a variable
A has a positive influence on a variable B in some context and
a negative influence in another context, then the influence of
A on B is modelled as being ambiguous.
As context-specific independences basically are qualitative
by nature, we feel that they can and should be captured explicitly
in a qualitative probabilistic network. For this purpose,
we introduce a notion of context-specific sign. We extend
the basic formalism of qualitative networks by providing for
the inclusion of context-specific information about influences
and show that exploiting this information upon inference can
prevent unnecessarily weak results. The paper is organised
as follows. In Section 2, we provide some preliminaries concerning
qualitative probabilistic networks. We present two
examples of the type of information that can be hidden in
qualitative influences, in Section 3. We present our extended
formalism and associated algorithm for exploiting context-specific
information in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss
the context-specific information that is hidden in the qualitative
abstractions of two real-life probabilistic networks. In
Section 6, we briefly show that context-specific information
can also be incorporated in qualitative probabilistic networks
that include a qualitative notion of strength of influences. The
paper ends with some concluding observations in Section 7.
Qualitative probabilistic networks
A qualitative probabilistic network models statistical variables
as nodes in its digraph; from now on, we use the terms
variable and node interchangeably. We assume, without loss
of generality, that all variables are binary, using a and  a to indicate
the values true and false for variable A, respectively. A
qualitative network further associates with its digraph a set of
qualitative influences, describing probabilistic relationships
between the variables [Wellman, 1990] . A qualitative influence
associated with an arc A ! B expresses how the values
of node A influence the probabilities of the values of node B.
A positive qualitative influence, for example, of A on B, denoted
that observing higher values for
node A makes higher values for node B more likely, regardless
of any other influences on B, that is,
for any combination of values x for the set X of parents of B
other than A. The '+' in S + (A; B) is termed the influence's
sign. A negative qualitative influence S , and a zero qualitative
influence S 0 , are defined analogously. If the influence
of node A on node B is non-monotonic or unknown, we say
that it is ambiguous, denoted S ? (A; B).
The set of influences of a qualitative probabilistic network
exhibits various properties [Wellman, 1990] . The symmetry
property states that, if S - (A; B), then also S - (B; A),
?g. The transitivity property asserts that a sequence
of qualitative influences along a chain that specifies
at most one incoming arc per node, combine into a single influence
with
the
-operator from Table 1. The composition
property asserts that multiple influences between two nodes
along parallel chains combine into a single influence with the
-operator.

The
- and -operators.
A qualitative network further captures qualitative synergies
between three or more nodes; for details we refer to [Druzdzel
For inference with a qualitative network, an efficient algorithm
is available [Druzdzel & Henrion, 1993 ] . The basic
idea of the algorithm is to trace the effect of observing a
node's value on the other nodes in the network by message
passing between neighbouring nodes. For each node, a node
sign is determined, indicating the direction of change in the
node's probability distribution occasioned by the new observation
given all previously observed node values. Initially, all
node signs equal '0'. For the newly observed node, an appropriate
sign is entered, that is, either a '+' for the observed
value true or a ' ' for the value false. Each node receiving a
message updates its node sign and subsequently sends a message
to each neighbour whose sign needs updating. The sign
of this message is
the
-product of the node's (new) sign and
the sign of the influence it traverses. This process is repeated
throughout the network, building on the properties of sym-
metry, transitivity, and composition of influences. Since each
node can change its sign at most twice, once from '0' to `+'
or ' ', and then only to `?', the process visits each node at
most twice and is therefore guaranteed to halt.
3 Context-independent signs
Context-specific information cannot be represented explicitly
in a qualitative probabilistic network, but is hidden in the net-
work's qualitative influences. If, for example, the influence of
a node A on a node B is positive for one combination of values
for the set X of B's parents other than A, and zero for all
other combinations of values for X , then the influence of A
on B is positive by definition. The zero influences are hidden
due to the fact that the inequality in the definition of qualitative
influence is not strict. We present an example illustrating
such hidden zeroes.

Figure

1: The qualitative surgery network.
Example 1 The qualitative network from Figure 1 represents
a highly simplified fragment of knowledge in oncology; it
pertains to the effects and complications to be expected from
treatment of oesophageal cancer. Node L models the life expectancy
of a patient after therapy; the value l indicates that
the patient will survive for at least one year. Node T models
the therapy instilled; we consider surgery, modelled by t, and
no treatment, modelled by  t, as the only alternatives. The effect
to be attained from surgery is a radical resection of the
oesophageal tumour, modelled by node R. After surgery a
life-threatening pulmonary complication, modelled by node
may result; the occurrence of this complication is heavily
influenced by whether or not the patient is a smoker, modelled
by node S.
We consider the conditional probabilities from a quantified
network representing the same knowledge. We would like to
note that these probabilities serve illustrative purposes
although not entirely unrealistic, they have not been specified
by domain experts. The probability of attaining a radical resection
upon surgery is Pr(r
there can be no radical resection, we have Pr(r j  t
From these probabilities we have that node T indeed exerts
a positive qualitative influence on node R. The probabilities
of a pulmonary complication occurring and of a patient's life
expectancy after therapy are, respectively,
From the left table, we verify that both T and S exert a positive
qualitative influence on node P . The fact that the influence
of T on P is actually zero in the context of the value  s for
node S, is not apparent from the influence's sign. Note that
this zero influence does not arise from the probabilities being
zero, but rather from their having the same value. From the
right table we verify that node R exerts a positive influence
on node L; the qualitative influence of P on L is negative.
The previous example shows that the level of representation
detail of a qualitative network can result in information hid-
ing. As a consequence, unnecessarily weak answers may result
upon inference. For example, from the probabilities involved
we know that performing surgery on a non-smoker has
a positive influence on life expectancy. Due to the conflicting
reasoning chains from T to L in the qualitative network, how-
ever, entering the observation t for node T will result in a '?'
for node L, indicating that the influence is unknown.
We recall from the definition of qualitative influence that
the sign of an influence of a node A on a node B is independent
of the values for the set X of parents of B other than
A. A '?' for the influence of A on B may therefore hide the
information that node A has a positive influence on node B
for some combination of values of X and a negative influence
for another combination. If so, the ambiguous influence
is non-monotonic in nature and can in fact be looked upon as
specifying different signs for different contexts. We present
an example to illustrate this observation.

Figure

2: The qualitative cervical metastases network.
Example 2 The qualitative network from Figure 2 represents
another fragment of knowledge in oncology; it pertains to the
metastasis of oesophageal cancer. Node L represents the location
of the primary tumour that is known to be present in a
patient's oesophagus; the value l models that the tumour resides
in the lower two-third of the oesophagus and the value
l expresses that the tumour is in the oesophagus' upper one-
third. An oesophageal tumour upon growth typically gives
rise to lymphatic metastases, the extent of which are captured
by node M . The value
of M indicates that just the local
and regional lymph nodes are affected; m denotes that distant
lymph nodes are affected. Which lymph nodes are local or
regional and which are distant depends on the location of the
tumour in the oesophagus. The lymph nodes in the neck, or
cervix, for example, are regional for a tumour in the upper
one-third of the oesophagus and distant otherwise. Node C
represents the presence or absence of metastases in the cervical
lymph nodes.
We consider the conditional probabilities from a quantified
network representing the same knowledge; once again, these
probabilities serve illustrative purposes only. The probabilities
of the presence of cervical metastases in a patient are
Pr(c) l  l
From these probabilities we have that node L indeed has a
negative influence on node C. The influence of node M on
C, however, is non-monotonic:
The non-monotonic influence hides a '+' for the value l of
node L and a ' ' for the context  l.
From the two examples above, we observe that context-specific
information about influences that is present in the
conditional probabilities of a quantified network cannot be
represented explicitly in a qualitative probabilistic network:
upon abstracting the quantified network to the qualitative net-
work, the information is effectively hidden.
4 Context-specificity and its exploitation
The level of representation detail of a qualitative probabilistic
network enforces influences to be independent of specific
contexts. In this section we present an extension to the basic
formalism of qualitative networks that allows for associating
context-specific signs with qualitative influences. In Section
4.1, the extended formalism is introduced; in Section 4.2, we
show, by means of the example networks from the previous
section, that exploiting context-specific information can prevent
unnecessarily weak results upon inference.
4.1 Context-specific signs
Before introducing context-specific signs, we define a notion
of context for qualitative networks. Let X be a set of nodes,
called the context nodes. A context c X for X is a combination
of values for a subset Y  X of the set of context nodes.
we say that the context is empty, denoted ;
we say that the context is maximal. The set of
all possible contexts for X is called the context set for X and
is denoted CX . To compare different contexts for the same
set of context nodes X , we use an ordering on contexts: for
any two combinations of values c X and c 0
respectively, we say that
c X and c 0
X specify the same combination of values for Y 0 .
A context-specific sign now basically is a sign that may
vary from context to context. It is defined as a function
?g from a context set CX to the set
of basic signs, such that for any two contexts c X and c 0
with c X > c 0
X we have that, if -(c 0
0g. For abbreviation, we will
write -(X) to denote the context-specific sign - that is defined
on the context set CX . Note that the basic signs from regular
qualitative networks can be looked upon as context-specific
signs that are defined by a constant function.
In our extended formalism of qualitative networks, we assign
context-specific signs to influences. We say that a node
A exerts a qualitative influence of sign -(X) on a node B, denoted
is the set of parents of B other
than A, iff for each context c X for X we have that
combination of values c X y for X;
such combination of values c X
such combination of values c X
Note that we take the set of parents of node B other than A
for the set of context nodes; the definition is readily extended
to apply to arbitrary sets of context nodes, however. Context-specific
qualitative synergies can be defined analogously.
A context-specific sign -(X) in essence has to specify a
basic sign from f+; ; 0; ?g for each possible combination
of values in the context set CX . From the definition of -(X),
however, we have that it is not necessary to explicitly indicate
a basic sign for every such context. For example, consider an
influence of a node A on a node B with the set of context
nodes Eg. Suppose that the sign -(X) of the influence
is defined as
The function -(X) is uniquely described by the signs of the
smaller contexts whenever the larger contexts are assigned the
same sign. The function is therefore fully specified by
The sign-propagation algorithm for probabilistic inference
with a qualitative network, as discussed in Section 2, is easily
extended to handle context-specific signs. The extended algorithm
propagates and combines basic signs only. Before a
sign is propagated over an influence, it is investigated whether
or not the influence's sign is context-specific. If so, the currently
valid context is determined from the available observations
and the basic sign specified for this context is propa-
gated; if none of the context nodes have been observed, then
the sign specified for the empty context is propagated.
4.2 Exploiting context-specific signs
In Section 3 we presented two examples showing that the
influences of a qualitative probabilistic network can hide
context-specific information. Revealing this hidden information
and exploiting it upon inference can be worthwhile.
The information that an influence is zero for a certain context
can be used, for example, to improve the runtime of the
sign-propagation algorithm because propagation of a sign can
be stopped as soon as a zero influence is encountered. More
importantly, however, exploiting the information can prevent
conflicting influences arising during inference. We illustrate
this observation by means of an example.
Example 3 We reconsider the qualitative surgery network
from

Figure

1. Suppose that a non-smoker is undergoing
surgery. In the context of the observation  s for node S, propagating
the observation t for node T with the basic sign-
propagation algorithm results in the sign '?' for node L: there
is not enough information present in the network to compute
a non-ambiguous sign from the two conflicting reasoning
chains from T to L.
We now extend the qualitative surgery network by assigning
the context-specific sign -(S), defined by
to the influence of node T on node P , that is, we explicitly
include the information that non-smoking patients are not
at risk for pulmonary complications after surgery. The thus
extended network is shown in Figure 3(a). We now reconsider
our non-smoking patient undergoing surgery. Propagating
the observation t for node T with the extended sign-
propagation algorithm in the context of
s results in the sign
(0
L: we find that surgery
is likely to increase life expectancy for the patient.

captured, (b), by a context-specific sign.
In Section 3 we not only discussed hidden zero influ-
ences, but also argued that positive and negative influences
can be hidden in non-monotonic influences. As the initial
'?'s of these influences tend to spread to major parts of
a network upon inference, it is worthwhile to resolve the
non-monotonicities involved whenever possible. Our extended
formalism of qualitative networks provides for effectively
capturing information about non-monotonicities, as is
demonstrated by the following example.

network from Figure 2. We recall that the influence
of node M on node C is non-monotonic since

In the context l, therefore, the influence is positive, while it is
negative in the context  l. In the extended network, shown in

Figure

3(b), this information is captured explicitly by assigning
the sign -(L), defined by
to the influence of node M on node C.
5 Context-specificity in real-life networks
To get an impression of the context-specific information that
is hidden in real-life qualitative probabilistic networks, we

computed qualitative abstractions of the well-known ALARM-
network and of the network for oesophageal cancer. The
ALARM-network consists of 37, mostly non-binary, nodes
and 46 arcs; the number of direct qualitative influences in
the abstracted network - using the basic definition of qualitative
influence - therefore equals 46. The oesophagus network
consists of 42, also mostly non-binary, nodes and 59 arcs.

Table

summarises for the two abstracted networks the numbers
of direct influences with the four different basic signs.
The numbers reported in Table 2 pertain to the basic signs
of the qualitative influences associated with the arcs in the
networks' digraphs. Each such influence, and hence each associated
basic sign, covers a number of maximal contexts.
For a qualitative influence associated with the arc A ! B,
the number of maximal contexts equals 1 (the empty context)
node B has no other parents than A; otherwise, the number
of maximal contexts equals the number of possible combinations
of values for the set of parents of B other than A.
For every maximal context, we computed the proper (context-
specific) sign from the original quantified network. Table 3
summarises the number of context-specific signs covered by
the different basic signs in the two abstracted networks. From
the table we have, for example, that the 17 qualitative influences
with sign '+' from the ALARM network together cover
different maximal contexts. For 38 of these contexts, the
influences are indeed positive, but for 21 of them the influences
are actually zero.

Table

3: The numbers of contexts c X covered by the '+', ` ',
'0' and `?' signs and their associated context-specific signs,
for the qualitative ALARM and oesophagus networks.
For the qualitative ALARM-network, we find that 35% of
the influences are positive, 17% are negative, and 48% are
ambiguous; the network does not include any explicitly specified
zero influences. For the extended network, using context-specific
signs, we find that 32% of the qualitative influences
are positive, 31% are negative, 20% are zero, and 17% remain
ambiguous. For the qualitative oesophagus network, we
find that 54% of the influences are positive, 21% are nega-
tive, and 25% are ambiguous; the network does not include
any explicit zero influences. For the extended network, using
context-specific signs, we find that 46% of the qualitative
influences are positive, 22% are negative, 10% are zero, and
22% remain ambiguous.
We observe that for both the ALARM and the oesophagus
network, the use of context-specific signs serves to reveal a
considerable number of zero influences and to substantially
decrease the number of ambiguous influences. Similar observations
were made for qualitative abstractions of two other
real-life probabilistic networks, pertaining to Wilson's disease
and to ventricular septal defect, respectively. We conclude
that by providing for the inclusion of context-specific
information about influences, we have effectively extended
the expressive power of qualitative probabilistic networks.
6 Extension to enhanced networks
The formalism of enhanced qualitative probabilistic networks
introduces a qualitative
notion of strength of influences into qualitative networks.
We briefly argue that the notions from the previous sections
can also be used to provide for the inclusion and exploitation
of context-specific information about such strengths.
In an enhanced qualitative network, a distinction is made
between strong and weak influences by partitioning the set of
all influences into two disjoint subsets in such a way that any
influence from the one subset is stronger than any influence
from the other subset; to this end a cut-off value  is used. For
example, a strongly positive qualitative influence of a node A
on a node B, denoted S ++ (A; B), expresses that
for any combination of values x for the set X of parents of B
other than A; a weakly positive qualitative influence of A on
B, denoted S
for any such combination of values x. The sign '+ ? ' is used
to indicate a positive influence whose relative strength is am-
biguous. Strongly negative qualitative influences S , and
weakly negative qualitative influences S , are defined anal-
a negative influence whose relative strength is ambiguous
is denoted S ? . Zero qualitative influences and ambiguous
qualitative influences are defined as in regular qualitative
probabilistic networks. Renooij &Van der Gaag (1999)
also provide extended definitions for the -
and
-operators
to apply to the double signs. These definitions cannot be reviewed
without detailing the enhanced formalism, which is
beyond the scope of the present paper; it suffices to say that
the result of combining signs is basically as one would intuitively
expect.
Our notion of context-specific sign can be easily incorporated
into enhanced qualitative probabilistic networks. A
context-specific sign now is defined as a function
?g from a context set CX to the
extended set of basic signs, such that for any two contexts
c X and c 0
X we have that, if the sign is strongly
positive for c 0
must be strongly positive for c X , if the
sign is weakly positive for c 0
must be either weakly
positive or zero for c X , and if it is ambiguously positive for
may be (strongly, weakly or ambiguously) pos-
itive, or zero for c X . Similar restrictions hold for negative
signs. Context-specific signs are once again assigned to in-
fluences, as before.
For distinguishing between strong and weak qualitative influences
in an enhanced network, a cut-off value  has to
be chosen in such a way that, basically, for all strong influences
of a node A on a node B we have that j Pr(b j
contexts x, and for all weak
influences we have that j Pr(b j ax) Pr(b j  ax)j   for
all such contexts. If, for a specific cut-off value , there exists
an influence of node A on node B for which there are
contexts x and x 0 with
ax)j >  and
signs of ambiguous
strength would be introduced into the enhanced network,
which would seriously hamper the usefulness of exploiting a
notion of strength. A different cut-off value had better be cho-
sen, by shifting  towards 0 or 1. Unfortunately,  may then
very well end up being 0 or 1. The use of context-specific
information about qualitative strengths can now forestall the
necessity of shifting the cut-off value, as is illustrated in the
following example.
R P

Figure

4: Context-specific sign in an enhanced network.
Example 5 We reconsider the surgery network and its associated
probabilities from Example 1. Upon abstracting the
network to an enhanced qualitative network, we distinguish
between strong and weak influences by choosing a cut-off
value of, for example, We then have that a pulmonary
complication after surgery strongly influences life ex-
pectancy, that is, S (P; L). For this cut-off value, however,
the influence of node T on node P is neither strongly positive
nor weakly positive; the value therefore does not
serve to partition the set of influences in two distinct subsets.
To ensure that all influences in the network are either strong
or weak, the cut-off value should be either 0 or 1.
For the influence of node T on node P , we observe that, for
0:46, the influence is strongly positive for the value s of
node S and zero for the context
s. By assigning the context-specific
sign -(S) defined by
to the influence of node T on node P , we explicitly specify
the otherwise hidden strong and zero influences. The thus
extended network is shown in Figure 4. We recall from Example
3 that for non-smokers the effect of surgery on life expectancy
is positive. For smokers, however, the effect could
not be unambiguously determined. From the extended net-work
in Figure 4, we now find the effect of surgery on life
expectancy for smokers to be negative: upon propagating the
observation t for node T in the context of the information s
for node S, the sign
results
for node L.
Conclusions
We extended the formalism of qualitative probabilistic networks
with a notion of context-specificity. By doing so,
we enhanced the expressive power of qualitative networks.
While in a regular qualitative network, zero influences as well
as positive and negative influences can be hidden, in a net-work
extended with context-specific signs this information is
made explicit. Qualitative abstractions of some real-life probabilistic
networks have shown that networks indeed can incorporate
considerable context-specific information. We further
showed that incorporating the context-specific signs into enhanced
qualitative probabilistic networks that include a qualitative
notion of strength renders even more expressive power.
The fact that zeroes and double signs can be specified context-
specifically allows them to be specified more often, in gen-
eral. We showed that exploiting context-specific information
about influences and about qualitative strengths can prevent
unnecessary ambiguous node signs arising during inference,
thereby effectively forestalling unnecessarily weak results.
