An A Priori Error Analysis of the Local Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Elliptic Problems.
--A
In this paper, we present the first a priori error analysis for the local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG)  method for a model elliptic problem. For arbitrary meshes with hanging nodes and elements of various shapes, we show that, for stabilization parameters of order one, the L2-norm of the gradient and the L2-norm of the potential are of order k and k+1/2, respectively, when polynomials of total degree at least k are used; if stabilization parameters of order h-1 are taken, the order of convergence of the potential increases to k+1. The optimality of these theoretical results is tested in a series of numerical experiments on two dimensional domains.

Introduction
. In this paper, we present the first a priori error analysis of the
Local Discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method for the following classical model elliptic
problem:
@n
where\Omega is a bounded domain of R d and n is the outward unit normal to its boundary
for the sake of simplicity, we assume that the (d \Gamma 1)-dimensional measure
of \Gamma D is non-zero.
The LDG method was introduced by Cockburn and Shu in [25] as an extension to
general convection-diffusion problems of the numerical scheme for the compressible
Navier-Stokes equations proposed by Bassi and Rebay in [6]. This scheme was in turn
an extension of the Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) method developed

by Cockburn and Shu [19, 21, 23, 24, 26] for nonlinear hyperbolic systems. The LDG
method is one of several discontinuous Galerkin methods which are being vigorously
studied, especially as applied to convection-diffusion problems, because of their applicability
to a wide range of problems, their properties of local conservativity and high
degree of locality, and their flexibility in handling adaptive hp-refinement. The state
of the art of the development of discontinuous Galerkin methods can be found in the
volume [20] edited by Cockburn, Karniadakis and Shu.
Let us give the reader familiar with (classical and stabilized) mixed and mortar finite
element methods for elliptic problems an idea of what kind of method is the LDG
method.
ffl The LDG is obtained by using a space discretization that was originally applied to
first-order hyperbolic systems. Hence, to define the method, we rewrite our elliptic
model problem as a system of first-order equations and then we discretize it. Thus,
we introduce the auxiliary variable obtain the equations
\Gammar
Since these are nothing but the equations used to define classical mixed finite element
methods, the LDG method can be considered as a mixed finite element method.
However, the auxiliary variable q can be eliminated from the equations which is usually
not the case for classical mixed methods.
ffl In the LDG method, local conservativity holds because the conservation laws (1.2)
and (1.3) are weakly enforced element by element. In order to do that, suitable
discrete approximations of the traces of the fluxes on the boundary of the elements
are needed which are provided by the so-called numerical fluxes; these are widely
used in the numerical approximation of non-linear hyperbolic conservation laws and
are nothing but the so-called approximate Riemann solvers; see Cockburn [17]. As in
the case of non-linear hyperbolic conservation laws, these numerical fluxes enhance
the stability of the method and hence the quality of its approximation. This is why the
LDG method is strongly related to stabilized mixed finite element methods; indeed,
the stabilization is associated with the jumps of the approximate solution across the
element boundaries.
ffl The LDG method allows general meshes with hanging nodes and elements of several
shapes since no inter-element continuity is required. This is also a key property
of the mortar finite element method. However, in the LDG method there are no
Lagrange multipliers associated to the continuity constraint; instead, the Lagrange
multiplier is replaced by fixed functions of the unknowns which are nothing but the
above mentioned numerical fluxes.
ffl In the LDG method, on each element, both the approximation to u as well as
the approximations to each of the components of q belong to the same space, which
is very convenient from an implementational point of view. Moreover, the lack of
continuity constraints across element boundaries in the finite element spaces renders
the coding of the hp-version of the LDG method much simpler than that of standard
mixed methods.
us briefly describe the recent work on error analysis of DG methods in order
to put our results into perspective. Analyses of the LDG method in the context of

transient convection-diffusion problems have been carried out by Cockburn and Shu
[25], by Cockburn and Dawson [18], by Castillo [14] and more recently by Castillo,
Cockburn, Sch-otzau and Schwab [15].
The DG method of Baumann and Oden [7, 8, 9, 32] has also been analyzed by several
authors. Oden, Babu-ska and Baumann [31] studied this method for one dimensional
elliptic problems and later Wihler and Schwab [41] proved robust exponential rates
of convergence of the Oden and Baumann DG method for stationary convection-diffusion
problems also in one space dimension. Rivi'ere, Wheeler and Girault [35] and
Rivi'ere and Wheeler [34] analyzed several variations of the DG method of Baumann
and Oden (involving interior penalty techniques) as applied to non-linear convection-diffusion
problems and, finally, S-uli, Schwab and Houston [38] synthesized the self-adjoint
elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic theory by extending the analysis of these
DG methods to general second-order linear partial differential equations with non-negative
characteristic form.
As applied to purely elliptic problems, the LDG method and the method of Baumann
and Oden are strongly related to the so-called interior interior penalty (IP) methods
explored mainly by Babu-ska and Zl'amal [3], Douglas and Dupont [27], Baker [4],
Wheeler [39], Arnold [2] and later by Baker, Jureidini and Karakashian [5], by Rusten,
Vassilevski, and Winther [36] and by Becker and Hansbo [10]. All of these DG methods
for elliptic problems can be recast within a single framework as shown by Arnold,
Brezzi, Cockburn and Marini [1]; this framework should provide a basis for a better
understanding of the connections among them and lead to a unified error analysis of
these methods. As a contribution to this effort, we present in this paper an a priori
error analysis of the LDG method for purely elliptic problems.
We show that if polynomials of degree at least k are used in all the elements, the rate
of convergence of the LDG method in the L 2 -norm of u and q are of order k
and k, respectively, when the stabilization or penalization parameter C 11 is taken to
be of order one. When the stabilization parameter C 11 is taken to be of order h \Gamma1 ,
the order of convergence of u is proven to be k + 1, as expected. Indeed, this is what
happens for the interior penalty methods and for the modifications of the method of
Bassi and Rebay [6] studied by Brezzi, Manzini, Marini, Pietra and Russo [13]; the
penalization parameters of these methods are also of order h \Gamma1 . These results are
summarized in the Table 1.1.

Finally, let us point out that the order of convergence of u for the DG method for
purely convective problems is k +1=2. This order of convergence was proven by Johnson
and Pitk-aranta [30] and later confirmed by Peterson [33] to be sharp. Whether
4 P. Castillo, B. Cockburn, I. Perugia and D. Sch-otzau
or not a similar phenomenon is actually taking place for the LDG method, with the
stabilization parameter C 11 of order one, as applied to elliptic problems remains to
be investigated. Our numerical experiments for the LDG method have all been performed
on structured and unstructured triangulations without hanging nodes and give
the optimal orders of convergence of k for u and q, respectively, with C 11
of order h \Gamma1 and, remarkably, with C 11 of order one.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we present the LDG methods
and state and discuss our main a priori error estimates. We also give a brief sketch
of the proofs in order to display the ideas of our analysis. The analysis is carried out
in full detail in section 3 and several possible extensions are indicated in section 4.
In section 5, we present several numerical experiments testing the sharpness of our
theoretical results. We end in section 6 with some concluding remarks.
2. The main results. In this section, we formulate the LDG method and show
that it possesses a well-defined solution. We then state and discuss our main result
and, finally, we display the main ideas of our error analysis.
We assume, to avoid unnecessary technicalities, that the exact solution u of our model
problem (1.1) belongs to H 2
(\Omega\Gamma and that the solution of the so-called adjoint problem
satisfies the standard ellipticity regularity property. Extensions to more general
situations are discussed in section 4.
2.1. The LDG method. To introduce our LDG method, we consider a general
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method of which the LDG method is a particular but
important case. We consider a general triangulation T with hanging nodes whose
elements K are of various shapes.
To obtain the weak formulation with which our DG method is defined, we multiply
equations (1.2) and (1.3) by arbitrary, smooth test functions r and v, respectively,
and integrate by parts over the element K 2 T to obtain

Next, we seek to approximate the exact solution (q; u) with functions (q in the
finite element space MN \Theta VN ae M \Theta V , where
and the local finite element space S(K) typically consists of polynomials. Note that
for a given element K, the restrictions to K of uN and of each of the components of q N
belong to the same local space; this renders the coding of these methods considerably
simpler than that of the standard mixed methods, especially for high-order polynomial

method, we require the following local and quite mild condition:

Other than these properties, there is complete freedom in the choice of the local spaces
since no inter-element continuity is required at all.

where the numerical fluxes b uN and b q N have to be suitably defined in order to ensure
the stability of the method and in order to enhance its accuracy.
As pointed out in the introduction, we can see that the numerical fluxes b uN and b q N
are nothing but discrete approximations to the traces of u and q on the boundary of
the elements. To define these numerical fluxes, let us first introduce some notation.
be two adjacent elements of T ; let x be an arbitrary point of the set
which is assumed to have a non-zero (d \Gamma 1)-dimensional measure,
and let n + and n \Gamma be the corresponding outward unit normals at that point. Let
(q; u) be a function smooth inside each element K \Sigma and let us denote by (q
the traces of (q; u) on e from the interior of K \Sigma . Then, we define the mean values
ff\Deltagg and jumps [[\Delta]] at x 2 e as follows:
Note that the jump in u is a vector and the jump in q is a scalar which only involves
the normal component of q.
We are now ready to introduce the expressions that define the numerical fluxes in
(2.2) and (2.3). If the set e is inside the
domain\Omega\Gamma we take

our disposal. The boundary conditions are imposed through a suitable definition of

and
b u :=

Let us stress once more that the numerical fluxes we just defined are nothing but a
particular case of the so-called approximate Riemann solvers widely used in numerical
schemes for non-linear hyperbolic conservation laws.
This completes the definition of our DG method. The LDG method is obtained when
C 22 j 0; in this case, the function q N can be locally solved in terms of uN and hence
eliminated from the equations, as can be easily seen from (2.3). This local solvability
gives its name to the LDG method.
That this DG method actually defines a unique approximate solution depends in a
crucial way on the coefficients C 11 and C 22 . Indeed, we have the following result.
Proposition 2.1 (Well posedness of the DG method). Consider the DG method
defined by the weak formulation (2.2) and (2.3), and by the numerical fluxes in (2.4)
and (2.5). If the coefficients C 11 are positive and the coefficients C 22 are non-negative,
the DG method defines a unique approximate solution (q

symmetry and stability of the DG method. Finally, let us point out that the role
of the auxiliary parameters C 11 and C 22 is to enhance the stability and hence the
accuracy of the method.
2.2. The classical mixed setting. The study of our DG method is greatly
facilitated if we recast its formulation in a classical mixed finite element setting. To
do that, we need to introduce some notation. We denote by E i the union of all interior
faces of the triangulation T , by ED the union of faces on \Gamma D , and by EN the union of
we assume that \Gamma
Now, we sum equations (2.2) and (2.3) over all elements and obtain, after some
simple manipulations, that the DG approximation (q N ; uN ) is the unique solution of
the following variational problem: find (q VN such that

Note that these two linear forms contain all the data of the problem. In particular,
they contain both the Dirichlet and Neumann data, which is not the case for the
classical mixed finite element methods.
Equations (2.6) and (2.7) can be rewritten in a more compact form as follows:
by setting
We end this section by proving Proposition 2.1.
Proof of Proposition 2.1. Due to the linearity and finite dimensionality of the problem,
it is enough to show that the only solution to the equations (2.6) and (2.7) with

Hence, owing to (2.1), on every K 2 T and since uN is a continuous function
equal to zero on the Dirichlet boundary, we get that uN j 0. This completes the proof
of Proposition 2.1. 2
2.3. A priori error estimates. In this section we state and discuss our a priori
error bounds for the DG method. As pointed out at the beginning of this section,
we restrict our analysis to
domains\Omega such that, for smooth data, the solution u of
problem (1.1) belongs to H

boundary data are zero, we have the elliptic regularity result k u

allows us to use elements of various shapes with possibly curved boundaries. For each

element K be arbitrary but fixed. To formally state this property, we need to introduce
the set hK; K 0 i defined as follows:

Thus, we assume that there exists a positive constant 1 such that, for each element
These three hypotheses allow for quite general triangulations and are not restrictive
in practice.
The only assumptions we use for the local space S(K) are that it contains the space
of polynomials of degree at most k on K and satisfies (2.1).
Next, we introduce a semi-norm that appears in a natural way in the analysis of
these methods. We denote by H k (D), D being a domain in R d , the Sobolev spaces of
integer orders, and by k \Delta k k;D and j \Delta j k;D the usual norms and semi-norms in H k (D)
and H k (D) d ; we omit the dependence on the domain in the norms whenever

We are now ready to state our main result.
Theorem 2.2. Let (q; u) be the solution of (1.2)-(1.5) and let (q N ; uN ) be the approximate
solution given by the DG method (2.2) and (2.3). We assume the hypotheses
on the local spaces and on the form of the stabilization parameters described
above. The triangulations are assumed to satisfy the hypothesis (2.11); if ff 6= 0 or
fi 6= 0, we also assume that hypothesis (2.12) is satisfied. Then we have that, for

Let us briefly discuss the above result:
ffl We begin by noting that the orders of convergence depend on the size of the stabilization
parameters C 11 and C 22 only through the quantities - ? and - ? . This fact
has several important consequences:
ffi The same orders of convergence are obtained with either C 22 = 0 or C 22 of
order h. This means that there is no loss in the orders of convergence if
instead of penalizing the jumps of the normal component of q N with a C 22
or order h, no penalization at all (the LDG method) is used.
ffi The same orders of convergence are obtained with either the LDG method
of order one or C 11 of order h \Gamma1 and C 22 of order one.
In general, the same orders of convergence are obtained by taking (ff;
or by taking (ff;
ffi The most remarkable cases occur when \Gammaff; fi 2 f0; 1g since it is for those values
that - ? and - ? achieve their maximum and minimum. The corresponding
orders of convergence are displayed in Table 2.1 for k - 1.

ffl In the case 1 - k - s, that is, when the degree of the polynomial approximation
is less than needed to fit the smoothness of the exact solution, we see in Table 2.2
that the best orders of convergence for
P. Castillo, B. Cockburn, I. Perugia and D. Sch-otzau
respectively, are obtained for both C 11 and C 22 of order one. When C 22
is taken to be of order h or equal to zero, the stability of the method is weakened
and, as a consequence, a loss in the orders of convergence of 1=2 takes place. If
now C 11 is taken to be of order h \Gamma1 , the full order of convergence in the error of
the potential is recovered. The numerical experiments of section 5 show that these
orders of convergence are actually achieved. However, the expected loss in the orders
of convergence when C 11 is taken of order one is not observed, which shows that
in practice the LDG method is essentially insensitive to the size of the stabilization
parameter C 11 .
ffl The influence of the choice of the coefficients C 12 on the accuracy has not been
explored in this paper; we only assume those to be of order one. In [22] it is shown
that the LDG method, with a suitable choice of the coefficients C 12 , still gives the
orders of convergence of k
respectively, if Cartesian grids and tensor product polynomials of degree k in each
variable are used.

ffl For the case k - s + 1, that is, when the degree of the polynomial approximation
is more than needed to fit the smoothness of the exact solution, we see in Table 2.3
that the LDG method performs at least as well as all the other methods; it performs
better if C 11 is of order h \Gamma1 .

constant coefficients C 11 and C 22 , we obtain estimates of order one for
. This is one of the few finite element methods for second-order
elliptic problems that actually converges for piecewise-constant approximations.
When C 22 = 0, that is, for the LDG method, our numerical results, which we do not
report in this paper, show that there is no positive order of convergence in this case,
as predicted by Theorem 2.2.
Finally, let us point out that the hypothesis (2.12) is not necessary when
2.4. The idea of the proof. The proof of Theorem 2.2 will be carried out in
section 3. The purpose of this section is to display as clearly as possible the basic
ingredients and the main steps of our error analysis. As usual, we express the error
as the following sum:
where \Pi and \Pi are projections from M and V onto the finite element spaces MN
and VN , respectively.
a. The basic ingredients. The basic ingredients of our error analysis are two. The
first one is, as it is classical in finite element error analysis, the so-called Galerkin
orthogonality property, namely,
This property is a straightforward consequence of the consistency of the numerical
fluxes.
The second ingredient is a couple of inequalities that reflect the approximation properties
of the projections \Pi and \Pi, namely,
for any (q; u); (\Phi;
for any (r; v) 2 MN \Theta VN and (q; u) 2 H
As we show next, all the error estimates we are interested in can be obtained solely
in terms of functionals KA and KB .
b. The estimate of the error in the A-semi-norm. We have the following result.
Lemma 2.3. We have
A (q; u; q; u) +KB (q; u):
Proof. j (\Delta; \Delta) j A is a semi-norm and, hence,
Since
by the definition of A, (2.9);
by assumption (2.19);
P. Castillo, B. Cockburn, I. Perugia and D. Sch-otzau
we have that
and so,
The estimate now follows from a simple application of the assumption (2.18). This
completes the proof.
c. Estimate of the error in u in non-positive order norms. To obtain an
estimate of k e u k \Gammat;D , where t is a natural number and D is a sub-domain of \Omega\Gamma
we only have to obtain an estimate of the error in the approximation of the linear
functional  denotes the L 2 -inner product, by  (u N ) since
In this paper, we are only interested in the case but we give here the general
argument to stress the fact that it is essentially the same for all natural numbers
t. Error estimates in negative order norms are very important, as we point out in
section 4 of this paper.
To obtain our estimate, we need to introduce the solution ' of the so-called adjoint
problem, namely,
@n
Lemma 2.4. Let t be a natural number. Then, we have
KA (q; u; \Phi; ')
with ' denoting the solution of (2.21)-(2.23) and
Proof. Since ' is the solution of the adjoint equation, it is easy to verify that if we
set
for all (s; w) 2 M \Theta V ; indeed, note that problem (1.1) can be rewritten as in (2.8).
Taking (s;
by the definition of A, (2.9);
, by the assumption (2.19) and the estimate (2.20), we
obtain
An analysis of the LDG method for elliptic problems 13
and hence,
The estimate now follows from a simple application of assumption (2.18), and from
the definition of a non-positive order norm. This completes the proof.
d. Conclusion. Thus, in order to prove our a priori estimates, all we need to do
is to obtain the functionals KA and KB ; this will be carried out in the next section.
Then, Theorem 2.2 will immediately follow after a simple application of Lemmas 2.3
and 2.4.
3. Proofs. In this section, we prove our main results. We proceed as follows.
First, we obtain the functional KA for general projection operators \Pi and \Pi. To
obtain the functional KB , the projections \Pi and \Pi are taken to be the standard L 2 -
projections, just as done by Cockburn and Shu [25] in their study of the LDG method
for transient convection-diffusion problems.
3.1. Preliminaries. The following two lemmas contain all the information we
actually use about our finite elements. The first one is a standard approximation result
for any linear continuous operator \Pi from H r+1 (K) onto S(K) satisfying
any w 2 P k (K); it can be easily obtained by using the techniques of [16]. The second
one is a standard inverse inequality.
Lemma 3.1. Let w \Pi be a linear continuous operator from
H r+1 (K) onto S(K) such that
for some constant C that solely depends on oe in inequality (2.11), k, d and r.
Lemma 3.2. There exists a positive constant C inv that solely depends on oe in inequality
(2.11), k and d, such that for all s 2 S(K) d we have
for all K 2 T .
We are now ready to prove our main result.
3.2. The functional KA . In this subsection we determine the functional KA
in (2.18), up to a multiplicative constant independent of the mesh-size. We start by
giving an expression for KA which is valid for coefficients C 11 and C 22 that vary from
face to face, for any regularity of the solution. Then we write KA for
the particular choice (2.15), (2.16) of C 11 and C 22 in Theorem 2.2.
Let \Pi and \Pi be arbitrary projections onto VN and MN , respectively, satisfying
(component-wisely) the assumptions in Lemma 3.1.

Note that the above results hold for arbitrary ff and fi. If now we restrict ourselves
to the case of Theorem 2.2, the result follows after simple algebraic manipulations.
3.3. The functional KB . In this subsection we determine the functional KB
satisfying (2.19), up to a multiplicative constant independent of the mesh-size. Here,
we take \Pi to be L 2 -projection and Again, we start by determining
expressions which are valid for varying coefficients C 11 and C 22 , and we conclude by
considering the particular case of Theorem 2.2. We proceed as follows. We show that
there exists a form j (\Delta; \Delta) j B , which is a semi-norm in both variables, such that for any

Note that only the function values along faces enter the j (\Delta; \Delta) j B semi-norm. As can
be inferred from the proof of Lemma 3.5 below, this is due to the particular choice of
\Pi and \Pi as L 2 -projections.

From this lemma, we immediately obtain the following result.
Corollary 3.7. Let (q; u) 2 H s+1 2 \Theta H s+2 , s - 0. Assume that the coefficients
C 11 and C 22 satisfy (2.15), (2.16). The triangulations are assumed to satisfy
the hypothesis (2.11); if ff 6= 0 or fi 6= 0, we also assume that hypothesis (2.12) is
Then there exists a constant C that solely depends on oe, ffi, i, - , k and d such that
the constant C is independent of ffi.

computation,

Note that the left-hand sides of the above inequalities are trivially uniformly bounded

boundedness of these quantities. We emphasize that this is the only instance in which
this hypothesis is used.
Hence we obtain
\Theta

where C is independent of the mesh-size but depends on ffi and on the approximation
and inverse inequality constants, and
-h fi otherwise:
The result follows after simple algebraic manipulations.

have . The estimates of ku \Gamma uN k 0 directly follow
from substituting the expression of KA (q; u; \Phi; ') given by Corollary 3.4, and the expressions
of KB (q; u), KB (\Phi; ') given by Corollary 3.7 in (2.24), and bounding k\Phik 1
and k'k 2 by k-k 0 . Indeed, we get
and since minfQA j

This completes the proof of Theorem 2.2.
4. Extensions. In this section, we indicate how to the extend our main result
in several possible directions.
P. Castillo, B. Cockburn, I. Perugia and D. Sch-otzau
4.1. The case of polygonal domains. In the case of a non-convex polygonal
domain in two dimensions, our assumptions on the smoothness of the solution u of
our model problem (1.1) and on the elliptic regularity inequality are no longer true.
Indeed, if for instance the Neumann boundary is empty, the Dirichlet data is smooth
and f is in L 2
(\Omega\Gamma3 we have, see Grisvard [28], that u 2 H s+2
and ! is the maximum interior angle of @ Moreover, if the Dirichlet data is zero,
we have
see (1.7) in Schatz and Wahlbin [37] and the references therein. This is the elliptic
regularity result that we must use.
To prove our error estimates in this case, we proceed as follows. First, we note that
our main result Theorem 2.2 can be easily extended to this case; indeed, a simple
density argument shows that Lemmas 3.3 and 3.6 remain valid for s; t 2 (\Gamma1=2; 0).
Now we proceed as in subsection 3.4 and obtain the desired estimates by using the
above mentioned lemmas and the above described elliptic regularity inequality. The
estimate of the error in the j(\Delta; \Delta)j A -seminorm remains the same but the estimate of
the L 2 -norm of the potential has to be suitably modified.
For turns out that only for non-zero orders of

4.2. Estimates of the error in negative-order norms. It is very well known
that the error in linear functionals can be estimated in terms of the error in negative-
order norms. Moreover, Bramble and Schatz [11] showed how to exploit the oscillatory
nature of finite element approximations, captured in estimates of the error in negative-
order norms, to enhance the quality of the approximation by using a simple post-processing
on regions in which the exact solution is very smooth and the mesh is
locally translation invariant.
An analysis of the LDG method for elliptic problems 21

Table
Orders of convergence for
estimates of negative-order norms can be easily obtained for our general DG
method by following the argument described in subsection 2.4 and the technicalities
displayed in section 3.
4.3. Curvilinear elements. The analysis in section 3 covers the case of triangulations
of curvilinear elements affine-equivalent to fixed curvilinear reference elements.
The aim of this subsection is to show how our main result can be extended to the more
general case where such an affine equivalence can not be established anymore. This
is, for instance, the case when the problem domain has a boundary with a generic
curvature.
There are two distinctive possibilities to do that. The first one is to keep the finite
element spaces described in the introduction; in this case, the local space S(K) could
be taken to be simply P k (K), for example. For our main result to hold in this case,
only Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 would have to be proven for these elements and for the case
in which \Pi is the L 2 -projection.
The other possibility is to consider elements obtained through the so-called Piola
transformation [12, Section III.1.3]. This transformation associates the function (q; u)
defined on K to the function (b q; b u) defined on b
K by
where FK denotes the mapping from b
K to K. With the above notation, our finite
element spaces are given by
It is easy to verify that the following properties are satisfied on each element K of
22 P. Castillo, B. Cockburn, I. Perugia and D. Sch-otzau
our triangulation:
Z
Z
Z
r
Z
Z
Z
This implies that with this choice of finite element spaces, our main result holds if Lemmas
3.1 and 3.2 hold for the reference element b
K and for the standard L 2 -projection,
provided the mappings FK are sufficiently smooth; see [12] and the references therein.
Indeed, the proof of section 3 holds in this case if we use the projections \Pi and \Pi
defined by
d \Piq := b
\Pi is the L 2 -projection into the space S( b
K) and b
\Pi). The only
slight modification of the proof occurs in section 3.3 in the definition of j (\Delta; \Delta)j 2
to which we have to add the term k q k 2
This implies that an extra term in the upper
bound of the term T 1 in the proof of Lemma 3.5 appears which is easily dealt with.
modification of the proof is required at all.
4.4. General elliptic problems. The extension of our main result to more
general elliptic problems which include lower order terms can be done in a straight-forward
way by applying our techniques to the formulation used by Cockburn and
Dawson [18].
4.5. Exponential convergence of hp-approximations. In the analysis of
the DG methods considered in this paper, we have only derived error estimates with
respect to the mesh-size h and we have not exploited the dependence of our estimates
on the approximation order k. However, this can be done by modifying Lemmas
3.3 and 3.6 correspondingly; see also the work of Houston, Schwab and S-uli [38]
and the references there. In addition, by using the proper mesh design principles
and by obtaining suitable approximation error estimates in the elements abutting
at solution singularities, exponential convergence of the DG method can be proved.
See, for example, the recent work of Wihler and Schwab [40] who showed exponential
convergence for a model elliptic problem on a polygonal
domain\Omega for the DG method
of Baumann and Oden with interior penalties.
5. Numerical results for the LDG method. The purpose of this section is
to validate our a priori error estimates for the LDG method (i.e., C 22 = 0) and to
assess how the quality of its approximations depends on the size of the stabilization
parameters C 11 . Since C 22 = 0, the function q N can be expressed locally in terms of
uN and hence can be eliminated from the equations. In our examples we solve the
resulting linear system for uN by using the standard Conjugate Gradient algorithm;
in order to obtain as much precision as possible, the stopping criterion is such that the
absolute residual norm is less than 10 \Gamma12 . The approximation q N is then recovered
in a post-processing step by using the local expression of q N in terms of uN .
We present numerical results using sequences of structured as well as unstructured
triangular meshes fT i g, where the mesh-size parameter of T i+1 is half
the one of T i . The numerical orders of convergence of the errors are computed for
An analysis of the LDG method for elliptic problems 23
polynomials of degree 1 to 6 in the L 2 -norm and A-semi-norm. These orders are
defined as follows. If e(T i ) denotes the error on mesh T i (in the corresponding norm),
then the numerical order of convergence r i is
In all our computations, we take C 12 normal to the edges and of modulus 1=2. The
stabilization coefficient C 11 is chosen to be of order h \Gamma1 . We emphasize, however,
that for all our experiments no significant difference has been observed in the errors
of the approximations when C 11 is of order one. We also remark that results for
are not included either, since no positive orders of convergence have been obtained,
as predicted in Theorem 2.2.
5.1. Smooth solutions. In our first example, we investigate the order of convergence
for smooth solutions. We solve the model problem (1.1)
with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and empty Neumann boundary. The
right hand side f is chosen such that the exact solution is given by
cos
The sequence of structured meshes used in this example is created from consecutive
global refinement of an initial coarse structured mesh; at each refinement, every triangle
is divided into 4 similar triangles. The number of triangles of the meshes are
16, 64, 256, 1024 and 4096. Since our analysis is valid for arbitrary meshes, we also
perform some tests with a sequence of unstructured meshes. It consists of a set of
meshes such that the maximum edge length is less than a certain value. This value
is reduced by a factor of two, from one mesh to the next. In this way, if we take
two consecutive meshes, one is not the global refinement of the other. The number of
elements of the meshes are 22, 88, 312, 1368 and 5404.
We show the orders of convergence in the L 2 -norm of the error in the gradient
in the A-semi-norm of the error of (q; u) and in the L 2 -norm of the error in u in

Tables

5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, respectively. For both types of meshes, we observe that the
optimal order of convergence predicted by our theory, see Table 2.2, is achieved. Note
that since machine precision is achieved for very fine grids and high polynomials, the
corresponding orders of convergence are meaningless and are replaced by a horizontal
line.
To give the reader a better idea of this phenomenon, in Figure 5.1, we display the
actual errors in the potential u whose orders of convergence appear in the left side
of

(1.1) in an L-shaped domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The exact solution
is the function u ff , described above, with 4:5. For this test we use a sequence
of unstructured meshes, created from a global refinement of an unstructured coarse
mesh. The number of elements of the meshes are 22, 88, 352, 1408 and 5632.

as in the convex case even though the standard elliptic regularity result guarantees
an order of convergence for the L 2 -error of the potential smaller by
as indicated in Table 4.1.
A similar phenomenon takes place with the very smooth solution from the first test.

numerical results for the classical L-shaped domain test with a singularity at the
reentrant corner. We consider the model problem (1.1) in an L-shaped domain with
zero right hand side and Dirichlet boundary conditions such that the exact solution
is given by
For conforming finite element methods, it has been shown that the orders of convergence
in the H 1 and L 2 norms are 2
respectively. The
numerical results for the LDG method on the sequence of unstructured meshes described
in the previous experiment are reported in Tables 5.10, 5.11 and 5.12. They
show that the rates of convergence predicted by Table 4.2 are achieved by the LDG
method. Observe that the same rates of convergence as in the conforming case are
achieved.

6. Concluding remarks. In this paper, we present the first a priori error analysis
for a general DG method that includes the LDG method and allows for triangulations
with hanging nodes and elements of several shapes.
We have proven that the orders of convergence of the approximations given by the
LDG method with the stabilization parameter C 11 of order h \Gamma1 are optimal; these
results have been confirmed by our numerical experiments which also indicate that
the quality of the approximation does not deteriorate when C 11 is taken to be of order
one. Theoretically, a loss of 1=2 in the orders of convergence can take place but this
phenomenon was not observed in the particular test problems we considered; as a
consequence, the sharpness of our error estimates in this case remains to be studied.
We have also theoretically shown that the effect of taking non-zero stabilization parameters
C 22 does not significantly improve the orders of convergence of the LDG
method. An exception is, of course, the piecewise constant case in which the LDG
method has an order of convergence of 0 whereas the DG method with C 11 and C 22
of order one do converge with orders of convergence of at least 1=2 and 1 in the error
of the gradient and potential, respectively.
In this paper, nothing has been said about how to chose the parameters C 12 . In
a forthcoming paper [22], it will be shown that, in the case of Cartesian grids and
tensor product polynomials, the orders of convergence of the LDG method can actually
increase if C 12 is suitably chosen.
Let us end by pointing out tha the implementation of codes for hp-adaptive versions
of the LDG method for general elliptic and transient convection-diffusion-reaction
problems is the subject of ongoing work.
