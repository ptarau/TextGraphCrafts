The Conditioning of Boundary Element Equations on Locally Refined Meshes and Preconditioning by Diagonal Scaling.
--A
Consider a boundary integral operator on a bounded,d-dimensional surface in $\mbox{\smallBbb R}^{d+1}$. Suppose that the operator is a pseudodifferential operator of order $2m,$ $m\in\mbox{\smallBbb R},$ and that the associated bilinear form is symmetric and positive-definite. (The surface may be open or closed, and m may be positive or negative.) Let B denote the stiffness matrix arising from a Galerkin boundary element method with standard nodal basis functions. If local mesh refinement is used, then the partition may contain elements of very widely differing sizes, and consequently B may be very badly conditioned. In fact, if the elements are nondegenerate and 2|m|< d, then the $\ell_2$ condition number of B satisfies  {\rm cond}({\mbox {\bf {\em B}}})\leq C N^{2|m|/d} \left(\frac{h_{\rm max}}{h_{\rm min}}\right)^{d-2m},    where hmax and h min are the sizes of the largest and smallest elements in the partition, and N is the number of degrees of freedom. However, if B  is  preconditioned using a simple diagonal scaling, then the condition number is reduced to ${\cal O}(N^{2|m|/d})$. That is, diagonal scaling restores the condition number of the linear system to the same order of growth as that for a uniform partition. The growth in the critical case 2|m|=d is worse by only a logarithmic factor.

assumptions are deferred until a later section. However, observe if \Gamma is a closed
surface then the spaces e

be a real number and suppose that B(\Delta; \Delta) : e
R is a symmetric,
bilinear form satisfying
e
(Throughout, the notation a - b will be used to indicate that a - Cb for some
positive constant C that is independent of the main quantities of interest, while
a ' b is equivalent to a - b and b - a.) Consider the problem of finding
R is a bounded, linear functional. The existence of a unique
solution u for each f follows immediately from the Riesz Representation Theo-
rem. Typically, (2) arises from the variational formulation of a boundary integral
equation associated with an elliptic boundary value problem. If the surface \Gamma is
smooth then the integral operator associated with the bilinear form B is a classical
pseudodifferential operator of order 2m on the manifold \Gamma.
The problem (2) will be approximated by first constructing a finite dimensional
subspace
m (\Gamma) on a partition P of the surface \Gamma, and then finding
This problem can be written as a system of linear equations by introducing a nodal
basis Ng. The precise details will be given later. The approximation uX
is then written in the form
with the coefficients fff determined by the equations
or, in matrix form,
where [B]
The assumptions on the bilinear form B(\Delta; \Delta) mean that the matrix B will be
symmetric and positive definite. The solution of the system (4) is typically accomplished
by the use of a direct solver such as Gaussian elimination (Cholesky
or sometimes by an iterative solver such as the conjugate gradient
method. The size of the condition number cond(B) of the matrix B is important
for the quality of the answers obtained by a direct method or the rate of convergence
of the iterative method. Either way, a large condition number points to possible
difficulties and it is important to understand and control the condition number.
The classical version of the boundary element method seeks to improve the
accuracy by uniformly subdividing all elements in the partition. While this process
does improve the approximation properties of the subspace X , the condition number
is also increased. Specifically, the growth of the condition number depends on the
the order 2m of the operator and the number of spatial dimensions d, as follows
where N is the number of degrees of freedom in the approximation space; cf. Hsiao
and Wendland [7, Remark 4], [8, Corollary 2.1].
If the solution u has singularities or other local features then it is more efficient to
refine the partition adaptively so that the space X is tailored towards approximating
the particular solution u of the specific problem in hand. Often, the final adaptively
refined partition contains elements of very widely differing sizes. This also has an
adverse effect on the growth of the condition number. For instance, we shall see
that if 2jmj ! d then
where hmax and h min are the sizes of the largest and smallest elements in the partition

The severe growth of the condition number due to the local refinements might
easily mean that the advantages accrued by adaptively refining the mesh are dissipated
by the cost of dealing with the solution of a highly ill-conditioned linear
system. The purpose of the current work is to address this issue. It will be shown
that if the matrix B is preconditioned or scaled using the matrix diag B, obtained
by taking the elements on the leading diagonal, then the extra growth factor
in (5) depending on the global mesh ratio is, provided essentially removed:
That is to say, diagonal scaling restores the condition number of the linear system
to the same order of growth as would be obtained if a uniform refinement scheme
were employed. The growth in the critical case marginally worse.
The current work finds much of its inspiration in the paper of Bank and Scott [2]
for the finite element approximation of problems associated with second order elliptic
partial differential equations in two and three dimensions. The current investigation
focuses on boundary element equations and as such allows for operators of
non-integer and possibly negative orders. This means that the associated Sobolev
spaces are also of non-integer and possibly negative orders, resulting in a number
of technical difficulties. Nevertheless, the conclusions are simple and applicable to
the practical solution of boundary element equations on highly refined meshes such
as those commonly arising from adaptive refinement procedures.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section elaborates
on the construction of the boundary element approximation and on the conditioning
of the linear system, and concludes with a statement of the main result of
the paper: Theorem 1. Section 3 illustrates with numerical experiments how the
theory applies in practice to boundary element approximations of weakly singular
and hypersingular boundary integral equations posed on surfaces in R 2 and R 3 .
The Sobolev spaces are defined in Section 4, and we prove several technical results.
Theorem 9 in this section contains sharp estimates for the norms of standard nodal
basis functions in fractional order Sobolev spaces, and may be of independent interest
for the analysis of boundary element methods in general. Section 5 consists
of five lemmas, that together constitute the proof of our bounds on the growth of
the extreme eigenvalues of the stiffness matrix, with and without diagonal scaling,
and hence establish Theorem 1.
Partitions and Preconditioning
2.1 Galerkin Subspace
It will be assumed that the surface \Gamma is bounded and, for some fixed integer r - jmj,
is locally the graph of a C r\Gamma1;1 function over a C r\Gamma1;1 domain in R d . In particular,
this assumption is needed so that the Sobolev spaces H m (\Gamma) and e
later) are well-defined.
Let P be a partitioning of the boundary \Gamma into boundary elements K, as described
in [9, 11]. In particular, the non-empty intersection of a pair of distinct
elements K and K 0 is a single common vertex or edge. If \Gamma is a two dimensional
surface then K is typically a curvilinear triangle or quadrilateral. Each element
K is assumed to be the image of a common reference element b
K under a smooth
bijective mapping FK . Let
\Delta be a finite element in the sense of Ciarlet [5],
with the set b
consisting of polynomials defined on b
K, unisolvent with respect to
the finite set b
\Sigma of degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom are identified with
point evaluations at distinct nodes fb x
Ig on b
K. The placement of the nodes
depends on the interelement continuity requirements of functions in the space X ,
and standard placements are well-established [5]. The local nodes in turn give rise
to a set of global nodes fx denotes a suitable indexing set
of size N . A set of global, nodal basis functions f' defined by the
normalization condition
and the requirement for the restriction of each function ' k (x) to an element K to
be of the form b
w(b x), where (b x) for some b
. The Galerkin subspace
is defined by and has dimension N . If
order to apply Lemma 6 during the proof of Theorem 9, we impose the condition
Z
where doe is the element of arc length surface area (d = 2) on \Gamma. Condition
rules out certain placements of the nodes: for instance, if
is affine, then the nodes f\Gamma1=
3g on the reference element b
would lead to a discontinous quadratic basis function with mean value zero.
Each partition P belongs to a family of partitions of \Gamma. The family is assumed to
be non-degenerate, so that the ratio of the diameter of an element to the diameter
of its largest inscribed ball is uniformly bounded over the whole family. It is also
assumed that the number of elements intersecting \Gamma k , the support of ' k , is also
uniformly bounded. Associated with each nodal basis function ' k is a parameter
defined to be the average of the diameters of the elements forming the support \Gamma k .
The non-degeneracy assumption implies, if d - 2, that the ratio of the diameters of
any pair of adjacent elements is uniformly bounded (that is, the partition is locally
quasi-uniform). In the one dimensional case, assumption is stipulated
separately. It is important to realize that locally quasi-uniform partitions may still
contain elements of greatly differing size. Indeed, if hmax and h min respectively
denote the diameters of the largest and smallest elements in the mesh, then the
global mesh ratio hmax=h min may be arbitrarily large. In particular, the assumptions
do not rule out families of partitions of the type generated by adaptive refinement
algorithms starting from an initial coarse mesh and creating a sequence of nested
partitions by selectively refining elements on the basis of some suitable criterion.
2.2 Conditioning of Stiffness Matrix
The Galerkin approximation entails the solution of a linear system of the form
One of our goals is to obtain bounds on the growth of the condition number of the
stiffness matrix B in terms of the number of degrees of freedom N and the mesh
quantities hmax and h min . The basic strategy is to determine positive quantities -
and  , depending on the partition, such that
min Nh 2d
min N \Gamma2m=d h d\Gamma2m

constructed from the standard nodal basis functions.
This equivalence yields bounds on the actual minimum eigenvalue -   (B) and maximum
eigenvalue     (B), since
and
Consequently the ' 2 -condition number of the matrix may be bounded as

For the purposes of analysis, it is convenient to reformulate (7) in terms of functions
from the Galerkin subspace X , by defining an isomorphism R N 3 ff using
the rule
The assumptions on the bilinear form and properties of the basis functions imply
that

Therefore, the task of establishing (7) is equivalent to determining positive quantities
- and   such that:
e
In particular, such an estimate also gives bounds on the behaviour of the largest and
smallest eigenvalues. A summary of the results obtained in Section 5, concerning
the behaviour of the eigenvalues, is given in Table 1. The results indicate that the
smallest eigenvalue decreases according to the size h min of the smallest element,
while the largest eigenvalue decreases according to the size hmax of the largest
element. Overall, this means that the ' 2 -condition number of the stiffness matrix
is dangerously sensitive to the global mesh ratio hmax=h min .
2.3 Preconditioning by Diagonal Scaling
One can attempt to control the growth of the condition number by means of a
preconditioner. Let D be the diagonal matrix formed from the entries on the leading
min )j

for B in an iterative solver since this only entails scaling the residual by D \Gamma1 at
each iteration. The effectiveness of the preconditioner depends on the condition

Of course, this matrix is never actually constructed in practice. The goal now, is
to obtain bounds on the growth of the condition number of the diagonally scaled

partition. As before, the basic strategy is to determine positive quantities - 0 and

summarizes our results, proved in Section 5, concerning the growth or
decay of the extreme eigenvalues of the diagonally scaled stiffness matrix. It will
be observed that the effect of the preconditioner is to remove essentially the factors
involving the extreme mesh sizes hmax and h min from the bounds on the eigenvalues
of the condition number of the original stiffness matrix. In other words, a simple
diagonal scaling restores the growth of the condition number to the same order as
would be observed on a uniform mesh. The numerical results reported in Section 3
indicate that our one-sided bounds are usually, but not always (see Tables 7, 8 and
12), achieved in practice for realistic problems and meshes. It appears that the
bounds cannot be improved (except perhaps for some of the logarithmic factors)
unless one imposes additional restrictions on the mesh.

3 Numerical Examples
We illustrate the our general theory by considering some weakly singular
\Gamma1=2) and hypersingular integral equations on various boundaries
2.
These boundary integral equations were discretized on uniform and non-uniform
meshes using varying numbers of degrees of freedom N . The functions in the
Galerkin subspace X were piecewise-constant in the case of the weakly singular
equations, and piecewise-linear in the case of the hypersingular equations. We computed
the extreme eigenvalues -   and     , and also the condition number     =-   , of
the stiffness matrix B and of the diagonally scaled stiffness matrix B 0 . The numerical
values of these quantities, along with their apparent growth or decay exponents,
are given in the tables that follow, and compared with our theoretical bounds from

Tables

1 and 2, and from Theorem 1.
Three different boundaries \Gamma were considered:
Boundary 1: the L-shaped polygon in R 2 having vertices (0; 0), (0; 1),
Boundary 2: the open curve (\Gamma1; 1) \Theta f0g in R 2
Boundary 3: the screen (\Gamma1; 1) \Theta (\Gamma1; 1) \Theta f0g in R 3
3.1 Weakly Singular Equations
The weakly singular equations arise when boundary integral methods are used to
solve the Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian in domains in R 2 or R 3 with boundaries
defined as above. The integral equations take the forms shown below.

If B(\Delta; \Delta) is the bilinear form associated with the operator on the left-hand side of
each of (12), (13), or (14), then it is shown in [6, 12] that
e
Hence, our assumption (1) is satisfied with \Gamma1=2. The factor 5 appearing in
(12) ensures that the bilinear form is positive definite; see [10].
3.2 Hypersingular Equations
First kind integral equations with hypersingular kernels arise when boundary integral
methods are used to solve the Neumann problem for the Laplacian in domains
in R 2 or R 3 . These equations take the forms shown below.

If B(\Delta; \Delta) is the bilinear form associated with the operator on the left-hand side of
each of (15), (16), or (17), then it is shown in [6, 15] that
e
Once again, our assumption (1) is satisfied, now with +1=2. The second term
on the left-hand side of equation (15) ensures that the bilinear form is positive-definite
and not just positive-semidefinite; see [10].

3 gives results for a quasi-uniform mesh (Figure 1), and Table 4 for a non-uniform
mesh (Figure 2) that is refined towards the re-entrant corner at (0; 0). In
the latter case, diagonal scaling leads to a very dramatic reduction in the condition
Turning to the hypersingular equation (15), we have
Indeed, the numerical results in Tables 5 and 6 show that, both for the quasi-uniform
and non-uniform meshes, diagonal scaling has little effect.
3.4 Results with Boundary 2
For the weakly singular equation (13) on the open curve, we again have
giving the bounds (18) and (19). For a uniform mesh, and for a graded
mesh with h observed the same growth
and decay rates as for the closed (L-shaped) curve, and do not tabulate the results
here. We also investigated a geometric mesh grading for which h
log h min ' \GammaN , we see from (18) and (19) that
In fact, the numerical results shown in Table 7 suggest that
our theoretical upper bounds are not attained for this mesh.
In the case of the hypersingular equation (16) on the open curve, our results
using a uniform mesh, or a graded mesh with h
gave the same growth and decay rates as on the closed curve, and again are not
reported here. Table 8 shows our results using the geometric mesh, for which (20)
gives
This time, the lower bounds are not attained, as we observe that -   (B) and -   (B 0 )
are decaying only very slowly, leading to very slow growth of cond(B) and cond(B 0 ).
3.5 Results with Boundary 3
For the weakly singular equation on the screen our theory
gives

Table

9 shows our numerical results for a uniform mesh (Figure 3), and Table 10
for a non-uniform mesh (Figure 4) that has been refined in a neighbourhood of the
corner (\Gamma1; 1).
Finally, in the case of the hypersingular equation (17) on the screen
Our results for a uniform mesh (Figure 3), given in Table 11, are as expected, but
those for a non-uniform mesh (Figure 4), given in Table 12, contain one surprise.
The minimum eigenvalue -   (B) of the unscaled matrix appears to behave like N \Gamma1 ,
whereas our lower bound is - . As a consequence, cond(B) grows at the
same rate as cond(B 0 ). However, all of the results shown in Table 13, for a different
non-uniform mesh (Figure 5), achieve the one-sided bounds from our theory.

4.3 Norms of Nodal Basis Functions
It is possible to obtain estimates for Sobolev norms of the nodal basis function ' k
in terms of the average size h k of the elements in the support \Gamma k of ' k .
Lemma 8 If ' k , k 2 N , is a nodal basis function, then
e

with constants independent of \Gamma k and p.
Proof. Follows immediately from Parts 1. and 3. of Lemma 4. The final result is
a simple computation.
Examining the proof of this result suggests one might also obtain useful estimates
by making use of Parts 2. and 4. of Lemma 4. However, the resulting estimates
would be sub-optimal as shown by:
Theorem 9 Let ' k , k 2 N , be a nodal basis function.
1. If 2s ? \Gammad, then

2. If sufficiently small,

3. If 2s ! \Gammad, then for h k sufficiently small,

In parts 2 and 3, we assume that the condition (6) holds.
Proof. If d, then we may apply part 1 of Theorem 3, followed by
Lemma 8, to obtain the lower bound
In the critical case d, we can use part 2 of Theorem 3, with

In the critical case \Gammad, we instead use part 4 of Theorem 3, choosing q 2 (1; 2]

Theorem 2 and Lemma 8 yield the lower bound
but this estimate is not sharp when 2s - \Gammad. Indeed, we see from Lemma 6 that
for h k sufficiently small,

The results for negative s follow at once from these bounds along with (25).
5 Proof of the Main Results
The earlier remarks indicate the key role played by decompositions of the form (8):
where v belongs to the Galerkin subspace X and v k is of the form ff k ' k (with
The assumptions on the partition P and the construction of the nodal basis
functions mean that the following properties are valid:
