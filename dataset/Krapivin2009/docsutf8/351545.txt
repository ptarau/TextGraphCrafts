First-Order System Least-Squares for the Helmholtz Equation.
--A
This paper develops a multilevel least-squares approach for the numerical solution of the complex scalar exterior Helmholtz equation. This second-order equation is first recast into an equivalent first-order system by introducing several "field" variables. A combination of scaled L2 and H-1 norms is then applied to the residual of this system to create a least-squares functional. It is shown that, in an appropriate Hilbert space, the homogeneous part of this functional is equivalent to a squared graph norm, that is, a product norm on the space of individual variables. This equivalence to a norm that decouples the variables means that standard finite element discretization techniques and standard multigrid solvers can be applied to obtain optimal performance. However, this equivalence is not uniform in the wavenumber k, which can signal degrading performance of the numerical solution process as k increases. To counter this difficulty, we obtain a result that characterizes the error components causing performance degradation. We do this by defining a finite-dimensional subspace of these components on whose orthogonal complement k-uniform equivalence is proved for this functional and an analogous functional that is based only on L2 norms. This subspace equivalence motivates a nonstandard multigrid method that attempts to achieve optimal convergence uniformly in k. We report on numerical experiments that empirically confirm k-uniform optimal performance of this multigrid solver. We also report on tests of the error in our discretization that seem to confirm optimal accuracy that is free of the so-called pollution effect.

Introduction
. The scalar Helmholtz equation with exterior radiation boundary
conditions describes a variety of wave propagation phenomena. One such phenomenon
is the electromagnetic scattering of time-harmonic waves, which, since the
advent of stealth technology, has helped propel an interest in e#cient numerical solution
techniques. However, such boundary value problems are challenging because
they are both indefinite and non-self-adjoint. Hence, standard numerical procedures
for solving them generally su#er from poor discretization accuracy and slow convergence
of the algebraic solver. Accuracy can be improved by taking meshes that are
refined enough for the given wavenumber, but such refinements are impractical for
many problems. Also, convergence of the iterative solver can be improved by preconditioning
the algebraic system, but finding an appropriate preconditioner is problematic
and, in general, robust iterative solvers for indefinite and non-self-adjoint problems
are di#cult to design.

Standard multigrid methods are no exception. Helmholtz problems tax multi-grid
methods by admitting certain highly oscillatory error components that yield
relatively small residuals. Because these components are oscillatory, standard coarse
grids cannot represent them well, so coarsening cannot eliminate them e#ectively.
Because they yield small residuals, standard relaxation methods cannot e#ectively
reduce them. Compounding these di#culties is the property that the dimension of
the subspace of troublesome components increases with increasing wavenumber k.
One approach to ameliorate these di#culties (cf. [9], [10], [21], and [23]) is to introduce
ray-like basis functions on the coarser grids, via exponential interpolation and
weighting, and to use multiple coarsening, where several coarse grids are used at a
given discretization level to resolve some of these error components. Introduction
of ray basis functions allows the oscillatory error components to be represented on
coarser grids, and successive coarsening with an increasing but controlled number of
grids allows a full range of these components to be resolved on the coarser levels.
Since the magnitude of the wavenumber k dictates the oscillatory nature of the error
components, then judicious introduction of exponential interpolation and weighting
and of new coarse grid problems as a function of k leads to multigrid schemes whose
convergence is k-uniform.
Direct application of such a multigrid algorithm to the scalar Helmholtz equation
would not generally achieve optimal discretization accuracy that is uniform in k. Because
k-uniform optimality of the discretization and multigrid solver is the central aim
of this paper, the multigrid algorithm will be applied instead to a carefully designed
first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) (cf. [11], [12], [21], and [22]) formulation
of the Helmholtz problem. This FOSLS methodology involves recasting the scalar
equation into a first-order system by introducing "field" variables, deriving boundary
conditions for these new variables, and applying a least-squares approach to the
resulting first-order system boundary value problem.
An important consideration in the numerical solution of Helmholtz problems is
the so-called pollution e#ect. The results in [3], [5], and [19] show that, for large
wavenumber k, even when kh # 1, the dispersive nature of the Galerkin finite element
discretization introduces a large phase lead error term and, in fact, a sharp H 1 error
estimate is contaminated by a pollution term unless k 2 h # 1. A stabilized Galerkin
least-squares finite element method was developed in [3], [5], and [19] to reduce the
pollution e#ect and, hence, to ameliorate the e#ects of this restrictive condition.
In the work presented below, because the FOSLS methodology leads to a minimization
principle, a Rayleigh-Ritz principle can be applied. Thus, standard bases
can be used to achieve O(kh) discretization error bounds in the least-squares norm
(that is, the norm determined by the functional itself) for the FOSLS formulation.
Our numerical results will suggest that this pollution-free performance is achieved by
the FOSLS formulation-not only the least-squares norm but in a scaled H 1 norm as
well.
Thus, the aim of this paper is two-fold: k-uniform multigrid convergence factors
and pollution-free discretization accuracy. Since a fast k-uniformly convergent solver
has been the most di#cult to obtain historically, this will be the primary focus of our
work. However, we will also show in our final numerical experiment that the FOSLS
discretization appears to be pollution free.
Substantial literature is available on computational electromagnetics. Algorithms
that apply to the time-dependent Maxwell equations or div-curl systems in general
include those described in [13], [20], [24], [26], and [27].
FOSLS FOR HELMHOLTZ 1929
Studies based on first-order system formulations of the Helmholtz equation include
[16], [18], [21], and [23]. The approach described in [16] does not include a curl
term in the functional, so its discretizations are somewhat restrictive and its standard
multigrid methods could not perform well with large wavenumbers, as expected.
The functional in [18] incorporates a curl expression but not in a way that achieves
uniformity in the discretization (or the multigrid solver, had they analyzed it). In
fact, except for [21] and [23] which is the basis of the work presented in the present
paper, none of the methods cited above were shown to achieve optimal discretization
accuracy and multigrid convergence.
For general literature on FOSLS, see [8], [11], [12], [21], and [22], which treat
least-squares functionals based on L 2 and L 2
(that is, a combination of L 2 and
products. The least-squares functionals described in the next section are
also based on these norms. In fact, the analytical techniques used in these papers are
also used to derive some of the theoretical results presented below. These techniques
enable the establishment of several uniform norm equivalence results that would not
be possible by way of the more restrictive Agmon-Douglis-Nirenberg theory (cf. [2]).
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the functional setting, the
first-order system, and the L 2 and L 2
least-squares formulations. In section 3,
a coercivity result for the L 2
defined over an appropriate Hilbert
space is established using a compactness argument. Unfortunately, this coercivity
estimate does not hold uniformly with respect to the wavenumber, so in section 4 we
introduce an appropriate subspace on which we do prove k-uniform coercivity. These
estimates provide an intuitive basis for the nonstandard multigrid method developed
in section 5. In the final section, we report on numerical tests that demonstrate k-uniform
pollution-free optimality of the discretization technique and multigrid solver.
2. FOSLS formulation. Let D # 2 be a bounded domain, which for technical
reasons (e.g., scaled H 1 equivalence of the L 2 FOSLS functional; cf. Theorems 3.2
and 4.2) will be assumed to have a C 1,1 or convex polygonal boundary # i of positive
measure. Consider the exterior Helmholtz boundary value problem
D,
Here, k is the wavenumber, f is in L 2
loc
#r
denotes the derivative in
the radial direction used in the asymptotic Sommerfeld radiation condition (cf. [14]).
To solve (2.1) numerically, the unbounded domain is truncated and the Sommerfeld
radiation condition is approximated. Thus, let B be a ball containing D (D # B)
with C 1,1 boundary # e , so that the region bounded by # i # e is annulus-like.
Assuming now that f # L

in# ,
Here, a first-order approximation to the Sommerfeld radiation condition is used.
Assume henceforth that (2.2) has a unique solution in H
Introducing the "field" variable
k #p, (2.2) can be recast into the first-order
system
in# ,
or
where L is the first-order operator corresponding to (2.3). Note that (2.3) is essentially
a scaled form of Maxwell's equations that has been reduced by assuming a transverse
magnetic wave solution. Variable p gives the electric field and variable u gives the
magnetic field.
To analyze (2.3) and the corresponding least-squares formulations, several functional
spaces are required. With s being a nonnegative integer, let H
s(# denote the
usual Sobolev space of order s with norm # s . With denote the
usual Sobolev trace space with norm # t (cf. [1]). Let # denote the L 2 (#) inner
product. The following spaces and scaled H 1 norm will be needed:
0,d
The boundary condition imposed in the definition of
W(# is to be taken in the
trace sense. Finally, let H
0,d denote the completion of L
2(# in the
respective inverse norms
(, w)
#w# 1,k
FOSLS FOR HELMHOLTZ 1931
and
0,d
(, w)
#w# 1,k
It is well known (cf. [17]) that [H(div; # H
1(# is a Hilbert
space in the norm
where
and
Thus, it is also a Hilbert space in the norm
Using the continuity of the trace operators from H
2 (#) and H(div;
(#), it is easy to see that W is also a Hilbert space in the # k norm
(cf. [22]).
Define the L 2 and L 2
least-squares functionals by
f
and
f
#-1,d
respectively. Both functionals incorporate curl terms that, with essentially no increase
in complexity for F and only moderate increase for G, allow for simplified finite
element discretization and multigrid solution processes.
For brevity, the equivalence results of the next two sections focus on G; we will
state but not prove the analogous H 1,k equivalence results for F (cf. [21] for detailed
proofs of similar results).
3. Nonuniform coercivity:
W(#3 A compactness argument (cf. [7] and [8])
is used here to establish equivalence between the homogeneous part of the L 2
least-squares functional, G(u, p; 0), and the square of the product norm [#] 2

In what follows, C denotes a generic constant that may change meaning at each
occurrence but is independent of k. The notation C k will be used (in this section
when dependence on k may occur.
Theorem 3.1. There exist constants C and C k such

which is a contradiction. Thus, (3.9) must hold. The theorem now follows by restricting
this bound to the subspace
The analogous result for F is essentially obtained using a Helmholtz decomposition
of u. Its proof is very similar to the proofs of Thorems 3.5 and 4.5 of [21], and,
thus, will not be included here.
Theorem 3.2. There exist constants C and C k such
for all (u, p) #
W(# .
These theorems show that the homogeneous parts of functionals F and G are
bounded (with constant C) and coercive (with constant 1
Ck ) in
W(# . Unfortunately,
the coercivity constant depends on the wavenumber k, which means that standard
numerical solution processes can degrade in performance as k increases. In the next
section, a subspace of
W(# is introduced on which we prove the coercivity constant
to be independent of k.
4. Uniform coercivity: Z
#2 A fundamental problem with the Helmholtz
equation is that approximate Fourier components with wavenumbers near k produce
relatively small residuals; that is, oscillatory components are in the near nullspace of
(2.1). This degradation of the usual sense of ellipticity is also present in system (2.3),
which means that the homogeneous parts of respective functionals G and F are not
equivalent to the square of the product norms [#] 2
# 1,k and [# 1,k uniformly
in k. However, as we will see, these troublesome functions can be treated specially in
the multigrid coarsening and finite element approximation processes. To guide the
design of these processes, this section will establish equivalence results on a subspace
of
W(# that excludes these near-nullspace components. To this end, note that
1936 LEE, MANTEUFFEL, MCCORMICK, AND RUGE
is a dense subspace of H 1
0,d (see [6]) that corresponds to the range of the inverse

The subspace Z

oscillatory near-nullspace error components of system (2.3) that yield small residuals.
Hence, in this subspace, uniform equivalence statements can be made between the
least-squares norms corresponding to G and F (that is, the square roots of their
homogeneous parts) and the respective product norms [#] 2
Theorem 4.1. Let # (0, 1) be given. Then there exists a constant C, independent

We again state the analogous result for F without proof.
Theorem 4.2. Let # (0, 1) be given and k # 1. Then there exists a constant C,

Remark 4.1. While the coercivity constant in Theorem 4.2 is uniform in k,
the dimension of Z # grows with k (for fixed #). However, these troublesome
components can still be specially treated in the multigrid coarsening process without
increasing the order of complexity, as we will show in the next section.
5. Nonstandard multigrid. Some of the basic concepts of this section were
taken from or inspired by the work of Achi Brandt (cf. [9] and Brandt and Livshitz [10]).
The L 2 functional F , when it applies, is usually more practical than the L 2
functional G, which involves the somewhat cumbersome negative norms. For this rea-
son, the remaining two sections will focus on minimizing F (u, p; f). A Rayleigh-Ritz
finite element method is used for the discretization process. Let T h be a triangulation
of
domain# into finite elements of maximal length
let W 1 be a finite-dimensional subspace of
W(# having the approximation property
for (v, q) # H
W(# . The discrete fine grid minimization problem is the
following.

A standard multilevel scheme for solving either of these discrete problems is fairly
straightforward. Let
be a conforming sequence of coarsenings of triangulation T h ,
FOSLS FOR HELMHOLTZ 1939
be a set of nested coarse grid subspaces of W 1 , the finest subspace, and
be a suitable (generally local) basis for W j , referred to here as level j. Given an initial
approximation level j, the level j relaxation sweep consists of the following
cycle:
. For each
chosen to minimize
(By #(b, c) is meant (#), where #
f) is a quadratic function in #, this local minimization procedure
is simple and very inexpensive (see [23] and [25]). In fact, this minimization
process is just a block Gauss-Seidel iteration with blocks determined by the choice of
(b recalling that L is the first-order operator corresponding to (2.3),
the block system is expressed as
where
# .
Now, given a fine grid approximation level 1, the level 2 coarse grid
problem is to find a correction
Having obtained the fine grid approximation is corrected according to
Applying this process recursively yields a multilevel scheme in the usual way.
Unfortunately, if the coarser level basis functions are chosen in the natural way,
then this coarse grid correction process may not be very e#ective for the FOSLS
formulation of the Helmholtz equation. Di#culties can arise with error components
for elements in Z # . Specifically, trouble arises from error components that have the
approximate form
sin ## e k(x cos #+y sin #) ,
where # [0, 2#). The main problem is that, on a grid where
of this type are highly oscillatory and, hence, poorly approximated by standard
1940 LEE, MANTEUFFEL, MCCORMICK, AND RUGE
coarse grids, yet they produce small residuals and are therefore poorly reduced by
relaxation. A compounding problem is that there are, in principle, infinitely many
of these components since # can be virtually any angle in [0, 2#). More precisely,
as k increases, so does the dimension of Z # , which consists of elements that are approximately
of the form in (5.6). Fortunately, these problems can be circumvented
by introducing exponential interpolation and multiple coarsening into the multilevel
scheme ([10] and [23]).
Exponential interpolation. Exponential interpolation is used to approximate
the troublesome oscillatory error components of approximate form (5.6). But the ray
e k(x cos #+y sin #) is the problematic factor of this form, so a more useful characterization
of these error components is given by
s(x, y)e k(x cos #+y sin #) ,
where s(x, y) is a smooth function satisfying appropriate boundary conditions.
j be the components of the product space W j , which is assumed
for concreteness to consist only of continuous piecewise bilinear functions.
(These spaces generally di#er over # only at the boundary.) Also, let level j correspond
to a grid that is fine enough relative to k that components (5.7) can be
adequately approximated with bilinear functions, although only marginally so in the
sense that this approximation just begins to deteriorate on level j + 1. Now, exact
coarse level correction from level j is assumed to be e#ective at eliminating the
smooth components left by relaxation on level j - 1. At level however, the
ability of bilinear functions to approximate components (5.7) deteriorates enough to
contaminate two-level performance between levels j. Some heuristics show
that this occurs when 2 To approximate these exponential components

that agrees with e k(x cos #+y sin #) d at the
level j node values; that is, E #
(d) is the level j nodal interpolant of e k(x cos #+y sin #) d.
This has the e#ect of altering the usual bilinear interpolation formula that relates
coarse to fine node values so that the rays are better approximated. In fact, this
ensures that the level j interpolant of the given ray is in the range of interpolation on
all coarser levels determined by the corresponding #. Figure 5.1 sketches the real part
of a one-dimensional level 3 basis function d 3 and a typical ray basis element E #

polation: a given function d on level l > j is bilinearly interpolated up to level j, then
simply rescaled by e k(x cos #+y sin #) at the level j nodes.
Multiple coarsening. Consider now the case that level j is where approximation
of components (5.7) just begins to deteriorate. It may be enough to introduce one ray
(e.g., with in the sense that an exact correction from level
might then adequately correct "smooth" level j error. However, it is perhaps more
e#ective here to introduce a few coarse grids, one for each of, say, four rays (e.g., with

critically, as each level is coarsened, scale k2 j-1 h doubles and
essentially twice as many rays become oscillatory. To be more specific, suppose that
are angles corresponding to two neighboring level j rays in the sense that
these two rays were used to coarsen level perhaps others, but none were
needed with angles between # 1 and # 2 . Now, on any of the level
will be one for each ray, that is, for each coarsening), the ray with angle #1 +#2will
be poorly reduced in relaxation and poorly approximated by any of the level j
grids. This means that twice as many rays must somehow be used in coarsening to
level which in turn will again require ray doubling to level
This can be accomplished e#ectively by introducing two separate ray coarsenings
on a level that may itself have come from ray coarsening. Suppose that level
was created from a level j ray with angle #, and that the task is now to coarsen level
using rays of angles #. One way to accomplish this is to introduce the level
ray #
j+2,# . But now #

an operator to this function will generally require level j evaluations. Alternatively,
these ray coarsenings can be e#ciently introduced using intermediate level

then letting E #

means that the perturbed rays

having solved a coarse grid problem, its solution can be exponentially interpolated
up to level j using the angle perturbations in a recursive way. For example, if
j+2 is the solution of the level problem corresponding to perturbation
#, then s #
j+2 can be interpolated up to level j by first exponentially interpolating
up to level
then exponentially interpolating this result to level j using #. Since exponential interpolation
consists of a standard bilinear interpolation and an exponential scaling, then
this successive interpolation process is easy to implement. Moreover, since the exponential
interpolation operator is the adjoint of the exponential weighting operator,
then exponential weighting is also easy to implement.
Angles (#). The angles cannot be arbitrary, but must be chosen such that
an optimal number of exponential components are adequately approximated by the
perturbed ray elements. To describe this selection procedure, assume that rays are
first introduced on level j + 1. Then, to obtain adequate approximation, a simple but
tedious analysis [21] shows that the perturbation angle # must be chosen so that the
following approximation is within the level j discretization error:

these components, ray basis elements are naturally introduced, and this nonstandard
multigrid scheme has the same form as the standard multigrid scheme defined by (5.2)

that determines how the various levels are visited is best described by studying the
schematic in Figure 5.5. We will continue to refer to this process as a V -cycle, although
it looks very di#erent from a standard V-cycle below level j.
For this nonstandard multigrid scheme (which can be interpreted as a multilevel
multiplicative Schwarz method; cf. [28]), the level j coarse grid problem involves
subspace corrections from the standard finite element space W j and the ray subspaces

In fact, these stencils can be computed and stored prior to any multigrid cycling so
that the same relaxation routine can be used for all levels and angles.
Now, assuming that the stencils have been computed and stored before any multi-grid
cycling occurs, the computational cost of such a multiple coarsening algorithm
is generally not excessive. In fact, one such multilevel V-cycle requires only several
fine grid work units (that is, the cost of a fine grid relaxation). For example, consider
the worst case, when four rays are introduced on level 2. (The need for more rays
would signal a level h so coarse relative to k that the discretization accuracy would
be almost meaningless; in fact, the need for four rays on level 2 is already a sign that
level 1 accuracy is quite poor.) Then, for level j # 2, there would be a total of 2 j
level j problems. Also, for each j, if it is assumed that the stepsize is doubled at each
coarsening, then the number of fine grid work units required for relaxation is 2 -2j+2 .
Omitting the cost of ray interpolation (which is substantial but proportional to the
number of points) and other more minor operations, the total number of fine level
work units for a nonstandard V (1, 0)-cycle is then
which is only about double the cost of a standard V (1, 0)-cycle.
6. Numerical examples. For simplicity and to facilitate comparisons, the examples
treated here are only for the unit square. The lack of a Dirichlet boundary is
in fact a more severe test of the methodology in some sense. The results will include
multigrid performance for both the standard and the nonstandard schemes described

in the previous section. We also assess accuracy of the discretization based on ray-type
elements.
To facilitate assessment of the iterative solver, we first restrict ourselves to the homogeneous
boundary value problem (2.2) with The exact solution is of course
but this is useful for measuring asymptotic algebraic convergence factors of
stationary linear iterative methods such as multigrid methods since it avoids the limiting
stagnation caused by machine representation. The unit square is partitioned
into rectangles, and the functional F is minimized over the space of piecewise continuous
bilinear functions (possibly involving rays) that satisfy the boundary condition
on #. In most cases, the finest grid is chosen to satisfy

rays are first introduced on level

The relaxation scheme is nodal Gauss-Seidel relaxation (that is, block Gauss-Seidel
where a block consists of all of the unknowns (u h
# ) at each node #). To assess the
worst-case convergence factors, twenty multigrid V(1,0)-cycles (that is, one relaxation
before and none after coarsening) were performed starting from a random initial guess
). The convergence measure # is then defined as
where the superscript in parentheses denotes the iteration number. Tables 6.1 and 6.2,
respectively, summarize the results of twenty V (1, 0)- and two-level cycles for standard
bilinear elements. Table 6.1 confirms that convergence degrades as a function of k
due to the troublesome oscillatory error components present on the coarser levels.

factors are fairly uniform in k and compare favorably to the two-level factors for
standard coarsening. Moreover, they degrade only slightly when the exact rays are
approximated using the recursive scheme described in the previous section (see Table
6.5).
To test the e#ect of introducing the rays late in the multigrid solver, we reran
these examples but delayed the use of rays until kh > 1. As expected, the rates
degrade noticeably, as Tables 6.6 and 6.7 show.

We then used our FOSLS scheme to approximate p and the scaled gradient u =k #p. To isolate possible pollution, we chose various h, then varied k so that kh
is constant 1/64). The errors were measured by comparing the
discrete approximation (obtained after applying several multigrid cycles) to the exact
solution in a relative sense in the least-squares and product H 1,k norms. Tables 6.8
and 6.9 essentially show constant discretization errors for constant kh, with about a
factor of 2 decrease as kh is halved, which is consistent with the assertion that our
approach is pollution-free and O(kh), respectively.
