Asymptotic Size Ramsey Results for Bipartite Graphs.
--A
We show that $\lim_{n\to\infty}\hat r(F_{1,n},\dots,F_{q,n},F_{q+1},\dots,F_{r})/n$ exists, where the bipartite graphs $F_{q+1},\dots,F_r$ do not depend on $n$ while, for $1\le i\le q$, $F_{i,n}$ is obtained from some bipartite graph $F_i$ with parts $V_1\cup V_2=V(F_i)$ by duplicating each vertex $v\in V_2$ $(c_v+o(1))n$ times for some real $c_v>0$.In fact, the limit is the minimum of a certain mixed integer program. Using the Farkas lemma we show how to compute it when each forbidden graph is a complete bipartite graph, in particular answering the question of Erdos, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp [Period.\ Math.\ Hungar., 9 (1978), pp. 145--161], who asked for the asymptotics of $\hat r(K_{s,n},K_{s,n})$ for fixed $s$ and large $n$. Also, we prove (for all sufficiently large $n$) the conjecture of Faudree, Rousseau, and Sheehan in [Graph Theory and Combinatorics, B. Bollobas, ed., Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1984, pp. 273--281] that $\hat r(K_{2,n},K_{2,n}) =18n-15$.

Introduction
. Let be an r-tuple of graphs which are called for-
bidden. We say that a graph G arrows any r-colouring of E(G),
the edge set of G, there is a copy of F i of colour i for some i 2 [r] := rg. We
denote this arrowing property by G !
The (ordinary) Ramsey number asks for the minimum order of such G. Here,
however, we deal exclusively with the size Ramsey number
which is the smallest number of edges that an arrowing graph can have.
Size Ramsey numbers seem hard to compute, even for simple forbidden graphs.
For example, the old conjecture of Erd}os [6] that ^ r(K 1;n ; K 3

The conjecture was proved for 4  s  7 in [14].
Size Ramsey numbers ^
(and in some
papers F 1 is a small star) are also studied in [9, 5, 2, 3, 8, 10, 13, 12] for example.
It is not hard to see that, for xed s
This follows, for example, by assuming that s

has the required arrowing property. Indeed, for any r-colouring, each vertex of V 2 is
incident to at least s edges of same colour; hence there are at least v 2 monochromatic
K s;1 -subgraphs and some S 2 V1
s
appears in at least rtn such subgraphs of which
at least tn have same colour.
Here we will show that the limit lim exists if each forbidden
graph is either a xed bipartite graph or a subgraph of K s;btnc which 'dilates'
uniformly with n (the precise denition will be given in Section 2). In particular,
tends to a limit for any xed bipartite graph F .
The limit value can in fact be obtained as the minimum of a certain mixed integer
program (which does depend on n). We have been able to solve the MIP when
each F i;n is a complete bipartite graph. In particular, this answers a question by
Faudree, Rousseau and Schelp [9, Problem B] who asked for the asymptotics
of Working harder on the case we prove (for all su-ciently large
n) the conjecture of Faudree, Rousseau and Sheehan [11, Conjecture 15] that
where the upper bound is obtained by considering K 3;6n
fortunately, the range on n from (1.3) is not specied in [11], although it is stated
there that ^ r(K 2;2 ; K 2;2 where the upper bound follows apparently from K 6
Unfortunately, our MIP is not well suited for practical calculations and we were
not able to compute the asymptotics for any other non-trivial forbidden graphs; in
particular, we had no progress on (1.1). But we hope that the introduced method will
produce more results: although the MIP is hard to solve, it may well be possible that,
for example, some manageable relaxation of it gives good lower or upper bounds.
Our method does not work if we allow both vertex classes of forbidden graphs to
grow with n. In these settings, in fact, we do not know the asymptotics even in the
simplest cases. For example, the best known bounds on seem to
be r < 3
(Erd}os and Rousseau [10]).
Our theorem on the existence of the limit can be extended to generalized size
Ramsey problems; this is discussed in Section 5.
2. Some Denitions. We decided to gather most of the denitions in this section
for quick reference.
We assume that bipartite graphs come equipped with a xed bipartition V
embeddings need not preserve it. We denote v i
For A  V 1

where F (v) denotes the neighbourhood of v in F . (We will write (v), etc., when
the encompassing graph F is clear from the context.) Clearly, in order to determine
F (up to an isomorphism) it is enough to have
This motivates the following denitions.
A weight f on a set V (f) a sequence (f A ) A22 V (f) of non-negative reals. A bipartite
graph F agrees with f if V 1
A sequence of bipartite graphs (Fn ) n2N is a dilatation of f (or dilates f ) if each Fn
agrees with f and

so we call e(f) the size
of f . Also, the order of f is and the degree of x 2 V (f) is

Clearly,
For example, given t 2 R>0 , the sequence (K s;dtne ) n2N is the dilatation of k s;t ,
where the symbol k s;t will be reserved for the weight on [s] which has value t on [s]
and zero otherwise. (We assume that V 1 (K s;dtne It is not hard to see that
any sequence of bipartite graphs described in the abstract is in fact a dilatation of
some weight.
We write F  f if for some bipartition V there is an injection
such that for any A  V 1 dominated by a vertex of V 2

trivial lemma.
Lemma 2.1. Let (Fn ) n2N be a dilatation of f . If F  f , then F is a subgraph of Fn
for all su-ciently large n. Otherwise, which is denoted by F 6 f , no Fn contains F .
Let f and g be weights. Assume that v(f)  v(g) by adding new vertices to
letting g be zero on all new sets. We write f  g if there is an injection
(g) such that
This can be viewed as a fractional analogue of the subgraph relation F  G: h
embeds how much of F A  V 2 mapped into G B .
The fractional -relation enjoys many properties of the discrete one. For example,

The following result is not di-cult and, in fact, we will implicitly prove a sharper
version later (with concrete estimates of ), so we omit the proof.

Hence, to compute ^ r(F) it is enough to consider F-arrowing weights on

such a weight extremal.)
Proof. Let gn ! F be a sequence with V (gn )  L such that e(g n ) approaches

exists for each A 2 2 L . Clearly, remains to show that g ! F.
Let c be an r-colouring of g. Let - be the smallest slack in inequalities (2.2).
Choose su-ciently large n so that jg n;A gA j < - for all A 2 2 L . We have
that is, c is a colouring of gn as well. Hence, F i  c i for some i, as required.
Now we are ready to prove our general theorem. The proof essentially takes care
of itself. We just exploit the parallels between the fractional and discrete universes,
which, unfortunately, requires messing around with various constants.

4. Complete Bipartite Graphs. Here we will compute asymptotically the size
Ramsey number if each forbidden graph is a complete bipartite graph. More precisely,
we show that in order to do this it is enough to consider only complete bipartite graphs
having the arrowing property.
Theorem 4.1. Let r  2 and q  1. Suppose that we are given t

information gathered by our algorithm will be used in the proof of the ex-

In other words, in order to compute the limit in Corollary 4.2 it is su-cient to
consider only complete bipartite graphs arrowing Fn . It seems that there is no simple
general formula, but the proof of Theorem 4.1 gives an algorithm for computing ^ r(F).
The author has realized the algorithm as a C program calling the lp solve library.
(The latter is a freely available linear programming software, currently maintained
by Michel Berkelaar [4].) The reader is welcome to experiment with our program; its
source can be found in [15].
For certain series of parameters we can get a more explicit expression. First, let
us treat the case when only the rst forbidden graph dilates with n.
We can assume that t scaling n.

The special case r = 2 of Theorem 4.5 answers the question of Erd}os, Faudree,
Rousseau and Schelp [9, Problem B], who asked for the asymptotics of ^ r(K s;n ; K s;n ).
Unfortunately, we do not think that the formula (4.6) can be further simplied in this
case.
Finally, let us consider the case of Theorem 4.5 in more detail. It is
routine to check that Theorem 4.5 implies that ^

are able to show that (1.3) holds for all su-ciently large n, which is done by showing
that a (K 2;n ; K 2;n )-arrowing graph with 18n can have at most 3 vertices
of degree at least n for all large n.

implies that m  6n 5, which proves the theorem.
Remark. We do not write an explicit expression for n 0 , although it should be possible
to extract this from the proof (with more algebraic work) by using the estimates of
Theorem 3.3.
5. Generalizations. If all forbidden graphs are the same, then one can generalize
the arrowing property in the following way: a graph G (r; s)-arrows F if for any
r-colouring of E(G) there is an F-subgraph that receives less than s colours. Clearly,
in the case we obtain the usual r-colour arrowing property G
This property was rst studied by Ekeles, Erd}os and Furedi (as reported in [7,
Section 9]); the reader can consult [1] for references to more recent results.
Axenovich, Furedi and Mubayi [1] studied the generalized arrowing property for
bipartite graphs in the situation when F and s are xed, G = K n;n , and r grows with
n.
We

Also, one can consider the following settings. Let F i be a family of graphs, i 2 [r].
We any r-colouring of E(G), there is
such that we have an F-subgraph of colour i. The task is to compute the minimum
size of a such G. Again, we believe that our method extends to this case as well. But
we do not provide any proof, so we do not present this as a theorem.
